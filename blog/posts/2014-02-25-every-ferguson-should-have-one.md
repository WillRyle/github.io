Our little grey <a title="GainingÂ Traction" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/gaining-traction/">Ferguson tractor</a> has made the occasional appearance in blog posts as we've used it to get work done. While functional, it's not entirely complete. Apart from missing a toolbox, there's no tool kit. Every Fergie came with a basic tool kit and one key item in that was a special Ferguson Spanner.

Inches on the spanner translate to Imperial gallons in the tank. The big end won't fit through the filler so can't be dropped into the tank accidentally.[/caption]

The spanner is a simple open-ended item but what made it special is that between the two ends it was possible to do a multitude of tasks as most nuts and bolts were either one size or the other. In addition, the spanner could be dunked in the fuel tank and the fuel level read off on a scale marked along the tool.

I've been on the lookout for a replacement for some time, trawling second hand shops and on-line auction sites. I then noticed one for sale on TradeMe where the vendor was fairly local, so promptly put in a bid. I was leading the bidding until a few minutes from the end when some interloper out bid me and despite a counter bid in the dying moments of the auction, lost to the latecomer with a final bid of $32.

Disappointed, I resolved to carry on the search and had the opportunity while our friends were visiting to check out a second hand shop in Carterton that I hadn't been to before. Rummaging through a likely looking box of spanners, I couldn't believe my luck when I pulled out a Fergie spanner. It was not priced so asked the shop keeper how much - $5 came the reply. I paid and left with a warm glow of smug satisfaction that persisted for several days.
