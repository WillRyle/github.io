Among the many decisions we had to make when the build was under way were those relating to colour - the roof is ColorSteel, so that was one choice to make, the weatherboard was another, plus the trim colour, window frames, guttering, rainwater pipes, and even the chimney flue had colour options.

We settled on New Denim Blue for the roof and it followed to use that for the highlights everywhere else with the weatherboard a very light grey - though it probably looks white in all the photos.

The Pump House was built by the same guys that built the house, but left unpainted. It was an easy decision to paint it in the same colours as the house.

We built the garden shed and left it in its natural timber state, until last week when Denise decided to paint that, again in the same colours as the house. It looks very splendid and the consistent colour theme gives house and sheds a coherence that belies their more ad-hoc origins.

With an extended Christmas holiday, I've been tackling a long list of jobs that have been piled up for some time. This week it was time to make a new post box. This is a custom-made item of my design with slots for letters and newspapers, intended to prevent the soggy letters we get because the old box was overstuffed and it rained. It followed that, rather than leave the box natural wood, it too would get the same treatment as the sheds. Like any paint work, this also had the welcome effect of hiding a multitude of carpentry sins.

The finished item was installed this week, a sort of mini-me shed that Denise immediately dubbed 'The Mail <a href="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/mailshed-003.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2064 size-medium" src="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/mailshed-003.jpg?w=300" alt="MailShed 003" width="300" height="225" /></a>Shed'.

Resplendent in what is now the de-facto New Bolton livery, it even has a matching ColorSteel roof using offcuts left over from the build.

The much-needed and long-awaited garage, when it is built, will definitely get the same treatment.
