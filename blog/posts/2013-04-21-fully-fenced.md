With a lot happening earlier in the year, I missed posting about the final section of fencing which Neale completed at the end of January.

In addition to the two long boundaries along the front and side of the section, a third run was required to separate us from our adjoining neighbour. This includes a pedestrian gate for easy access to the neighbours and a larger gate for vehicles and stock movements.

Still to do are the gates. for which a local joiner has been commissioned.
