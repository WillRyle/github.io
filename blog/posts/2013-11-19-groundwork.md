Another labour intensive weekend has produced some good results and our improvised landscape rake made all the difference.

The problem stemmed from the dead grass being left behind, passing through the widely spaced tines on the rake. Some craft-work with chicken netting, a metal fence post and some wire and we were set to try again.

It didn't take long to get the material into heaps scattered about the paddock, then it was a case of changing the rake for the loading tray, making the tractor a motorised wheelbarrow.

In a re-run of last weekend's efforts, this time without the heat, we loaded pile after pile and carted it off to the ever-growing compost heap.

With the ground cleared it was time for another implement change. The levelling bars - hired again in anticipation - were fitted and put to work. The dry ground kicked up a dust but we got the result we wanted.

Next job is a light harrow, seeding and rolling. Meanwhile, more pictures...
