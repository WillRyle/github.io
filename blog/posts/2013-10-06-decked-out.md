Back from our sojourn to the old country to visit relatives, our programme of work at New Bolton continues. While wind and rain and time zone changes kept us indoors, handy neighbour and builder Trevor and brother Gavin, last seen building the <a title="Pause in Precipitation Permits Patio Pouring" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/pause-in-precipitation-permits-patio-pouring/" target="_blank">patio</a>, continued their good work with the latest project.

During the heat of Summer, shade is all important and in the effort to stay cool we found ourselves drawn to cover at the rear of the house to escape the Wairarapa hot afternoons, where temperatures can reach over 30C.

A deck here made perfect sense, extending <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/deck-001.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1728" alt="Deck 001" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/deck-001.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a>the patio, providing a shady spot to sit out and cool in the breeze and tidying the rear of the house to the same effect that the patio did to the front.

Trevor called in on Wednesday to say he was ready to start work the next day. We arrived home on Thursday to see the piles installed ready to take the bearers. By the time we got home on Friday the job was  done and looking splendid. <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/deck-003.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1729" alt="Deck 003" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/deck-003.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/deck-004.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1730" alt="Deck 004" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/deck-004.jpg?w=300" width="600" height="450" /></a>

No sooner had tools been put away than we found a use for this new space. A preview of the coming Summer saw temperatures reaching the mid twenties, quite hot compared to the period since we arrived back from England. We moved the table and chairs into the shade and chilled out in what hopefully will be the first of many occasions this Summer.
