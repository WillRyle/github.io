A major hardware acquisition was made this weekend, a piece of kit essential to any sizeable garden - and long overdue at New Bolton - this equipment is discussed at length by men wherever they gather and the topic of garden maintenance is raised.

It is of course, the ride-on mower.

This is one of friendly neighbour Doug's customised jobs, based on a robust Australian design. With a variable belt drive, it has no gears. A single pedal controls both speed and direction - toe down to go forward, heel down to go backwards. A hand throttle sets the engine speed and a lever engages the helicopter-like four bladed cutter. Another lever adjusts the height of the blade, a brake pedal is operated by the left foot and a parking brake lever completes the control set.

In its inaugural run with me at the controls it took about two hours to mow the grass, comparable to previous times by other drivers and mowers. What was noticeable was the unevenness of the surface as the mower dipped and bounced over hollows and bumps. Clearly, a mower can't have a suspension system if the blades are to be a fixed height above the ground at all times, so the only cushioning is in the seat and the, ahem, 'build' of the driver.
