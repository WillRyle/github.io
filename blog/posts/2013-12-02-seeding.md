It's been two weekends since we got the bulk of the <a title="Groundwork" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/groundwork/">groundwork</a> done. We'd planned to manually prepare the areas around the edge where tiller and tractor couldn't reach last weekend, but the weather was too hot for such labour and the ground too dry to put seed in. What we needed was a bit of rain...

...and we got it. All week. Every day. Nearly four inches of the stuff. Hopes that Saturday would see conditions to let us work were in fact met with more rain and strong winds that didn't abate until 4pm, after which we managed to make some limited progress.

The late start on Saturday meant more to do on Sunday, so we finished off the awkward spots and picked up the larger of the stones and rubbish littering the ground before starting seeding.

This was a largely hit and miss affair - we'd bought a seed spreader for the job, but the rate of application is determined by the size of opening in its hopper and the pace of the person pushing the thing along. There was no way to reliably calibrate the optimum seed coverage. In addition it was impossible to see which parts had been adequately covered in seed and which needed to be done - on the dry ground the tiny seeds blended in well to the point of invisibility. It's likely we'll have gaps and overlaps, but by my reckoning we've not used enough seed to give the recommended coverage per square metre, so I'm guessing we'll need to remedy that when we see what comes up.

With the seed down, the tractor was fitted with the chain harrow and using the 'light' side, the ground was harrowed to cover the seed. By now it was about 5pm and we'd still got the rolling to do. This is critical as the seed in loose soil would dry out and not germinate. Obtaining a roller though has been problematic - I won't go into the frustrating details - and we finished up using the very toolÂ  I wanted to avoid. Neighbour Trev's walk-behind engine driven roller is more suited to compacting ground for paving and driveways. I've used it before on the drive and it does a good job, but with over 3,000 square metres of ground to cover I would have preferred to use something tractor powered.

The speed of operation is governed by the machine and even in 'high' gear, that is just a steady stroll. Changing direction is done by heaving on the handlebars and this is not a lightweight machine. It was gone 8pm by the time we were done and able to adjourn to the pool to have the aches of our labours soothed by the hydrotherapy jets.
