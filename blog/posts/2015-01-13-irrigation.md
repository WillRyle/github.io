One of the biggest problems in the garden is keeping everything adequately watered. This is especially true in the vegetable growing areas, where good results depend on good watering and we've often been disappointed that our efforts haven't borne more fruit - or veg - because we've not been able to get around with the hose pipe at the crucial time.

We've tried a number of methods - spraying with a hose pipe is fine but time-consuming. Sprinklers may be good for lawns but using them on the veggie patch is a bit hit and miss, especially if it's a windy day as the up-wind side gets a short measure. The result has been that a newly tilled and planted veggie patch can be overgrown with weeds before the crops get established.

I looked at garden irrigation systems and have used them in the past and while they are fine for fixed planting like fruit trees, the network of pipes and spray nozzles needs reconfiguring every season as crops are rotated. Furthermore, the pipes on the ground are prone to damage from being trodden on, punctured by garden forks and cut by spades.

Another approach was needed and I looked to New Zealand's extensive agricultural industry for inspiration. We've seen the large irrigation gantries that spread across the fields, spraying water and pulling themselves over the paddock and wondered if something like that on a smaller scale could be made to work.

With an idea germinating in my head, I trawled the internet and stores looking for the components to assemble a bespoke irrigation system that would be portable to some extent, apply water just where we wanted it and didn't take too much time out of our day.

Using materials left over from other projects, some wheel and axle sets from <a href="http://www.savebarn.co.nz/index.php?route=product/product&amp;keyword=wheels&amp;category_id=0&amp;description=1&amp;product_id=179http://" target="_blank">SaveBarn</a> and some <a href="http://netagarden.com.au/" target="_blank">Neta</a> irrigation components, I came up with a mini linear irrigation system of our own for use on the crop area to the rear of the house.

The Neta spray nozzles are installed on a length of 19mm irrigation pipe - that I'd bought for something else - which is fixed to the underside of the horizontal beam. This gives the area underneath a good soaking. The supporting A-frames are mounted on trolleys which allows the device to be moved along the crop area. A home-brewed winch and roller mechanism allows both trolleys to be moved at the same time by one person.

The end result is quite effective and puts water where we need it quickly. With the hot weather here now accompanied by a sprinkler ban, we're using the tank water to keep things growing. <a href="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/bark-009.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2079 size-medium" src="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/bark-009.jpg?w=300" alt="Bark 009" width="300" height="225" /></a>Unfortunately there's not enough to spare for the grass which is looking decidedly browned off.
