Taking our latest acquisition for a spin around the section, Denise took these photos while I was chatting to a neighbour about tractors and fittings.

The purpose of our conversation was to arrange the loan of some levelling irons. Pulled behind Gus - for that is what Denise has named our little grey Ferguson - the levelling irons will distribute the soil to a flatness that a pool table would envy. <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/tractortillershed-003.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1603" alt="Tractor;Tiller;Shed 003" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/tractortillershed-003.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a>Such is the hope at least, more likely we will be rid of the bumps and hollows that abound and threaten to throw me from the seat of the ride-on mower, but I'm not expecting a perfect finish.

Given that everything takes longer than anticipated, I've elected to try my hand at the ploughing-levelling-rolling-reseeding process on a smaller section of ground - the area that will become the orchard. This has several advantages - being an orchard the finish is less critical than the main lawn area,

It will also allow me to measure the time and materials required and make a judgement on whether or not there will be enough time to complete the rest of the section or wait for Spring.</span>

In anticipation of starting work on the orchard area, I sprayed the ground with Roundup and take some satisfaction in the weeds dying off.
