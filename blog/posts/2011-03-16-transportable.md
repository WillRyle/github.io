No, but they are in to recycling. <a href="http://www.brittons.co.nz/" target="_blank">This</a> is the <a href="http://www.bigriverhomes.co.nz/" target="_blank">industry</a> of transportable houses, not just newly made ones but, as in this case, moving unwanted older houses to new locations. The 'new' blue house - and four more nearby - have been relocated by an enterprising developer from an army camp, where they were surplus to requirements to the new subdivision adjoining our section.

The buildings are set on piles in the new location, services connected and refurbished as required. Many house builders have some transportable homes in their product range, though they tend to be of limited size because of the need to move them.
