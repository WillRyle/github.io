Something different visited Wellington harbour this week in the form of the Chilean sailing ship Esmeralda. Denise and I met for lunch one day this week and took a walk down the harbour for a closer look.

This is not some heavily restored old sailing ship, but a relatively new steel-hulled, four-masted affair with the distinction of being the World's longest sailing ship.

I encountered some of the crew wandering around a cold and wet Wellington and they were the image of well behaved youngsters abroad.
