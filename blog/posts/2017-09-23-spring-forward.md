A long hiatus in blogging over the Winter finally comes to an end as the clocks go forward this weekend. Ordinarily there'd be the odd post over Winter, but frankly there's only so many ways to say 'it's still raining...'

We've not had too many Winters in New Zealand, but the one just finishing has to be the wettest, coldest and most thoroughly miserable of all of them. The odd sunny day - and Midwinter dinner at Geoff's - were the only highlights during a period where the newly installed <a href="http://wow.metoffice.gov.uk/observations/details?site_id=916476001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Bolton weather station</a> recorded over 2 feet of rain.

On the positive side, our supply of firewood lasted through the cold spell, the water tank is full and the ground has dried enough to allow us to prepare for planting out. Today was the warmest we've been outside in weeks and while we haven't seen the last of the rain, it'll be 'good' rain, watering the veggies. The chooks have started laying and are back in full production after the Winter lull, so we can look forward to the new growing season on a good breakfast.
