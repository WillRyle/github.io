The last few weekends have been busy instigating <a title="The Best Laid Plans" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/the-best-laid-plans/">Plan D</a>. Progress planting the sweet corn had been slow and I wondered that we'd given ourselves too much to do. Yesterday the situation changed with the return of the tiller - all serviced and fitted with new tines.

<!--more-->We'd turned the ground over with the tiller in preparation for the corn planting, but the going was still tough. I'd taken the machine to friendly neighbour Doug who set to work installing the new tines and servicing what must have been a long-neglected engine. By yesterday, (Saturday) it was ready and I brought it back to see what it could do.

The difference was spectacular. The machine ate the ground with ease, taking all in its path and turning it into a fine mulch. With all the tines fitted and the shaft straightened by gentle application of a sledge-hammer, vibration was noticeably reduced. The new tines cut to their full depth, jumping occasionally as they found a large stone and left a neat mound of earth in their wake. Where previously I'd had to make several passes to condition the soil, now a single run was sufficient.

Best of all was the speed with which the job was done - some 400 square metres of turf and weed was rendered into a fine tilth in about one hour. This also means that planting the seed is a lot easier - just a case of pushing each seed into the soft ground with a finger then moving on to the next. We now stand a chance of finishing  planting corn before the corn planting season finishes.

The corn we planted two weeks ago is peeking above the ground, so at least we know we're not entirely wasting our time. Doubtless by the time we've got the corn in, it'll be time to under-plant with peas.
