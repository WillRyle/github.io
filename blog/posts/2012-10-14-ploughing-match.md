Saturday was a washout - <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/7812408/Rockslide-closes-Milford-Rd" target="_blank">literally in some places</a> - with strong winds and heavy rain across the country. We were effectively confined to the house, watching near horizontal rain giving the vegetable patch a good watering and filling the newly installed <a title="Summer Time" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/09/30/summer-time/" target="_blank">water tank</a>. I passed the time by installing the light fixtures we'd bought months ago. By Sunday the early signs of cabin fever were beginning to show and with the weather still far from ideal, we headed off to the ploughing match to implement the first part of <a title="A Shortage of Horsepower" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/a-shortage-of-horsepower/">Plan C</a>.

We were greeted by the spectacle of a large field full of ploughing machinery ranging from horse drawn single furrow ploughs with the operator walking behind, to the modern tractor with its many fancy gadgets.

While the atmosphere was typically Wairarapa - informal, relaxed and laid-back - I noticed the competitors taking great care with their ploughing, tape measures in evidence as they set up to get the best furrow. They weren't here for the day out, but to show what they were capable of and to win.
