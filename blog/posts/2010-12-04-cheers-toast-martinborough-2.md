Ok, it's really just a very big party.

A ticket will provide the purchaser with a glass (complete with handy strap so it can be worn around the neck), admission to all the participating venues, and transport between venues to minimise the time not partying.

We've always managed to miss the event, tickets are much sought after and are soon sold out, but this year a co-worker with connections to a participating vineyard asked if we'd volunteer to help out by serving drinks to the visitors. There was a pack lunch and barbecue after for the volunteers, so we agreed.<a href="http://atarangi.co.nz/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-84" title="Ata Rangi Vineyard" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/atarangi1.jpg" alt="Ata Rangi Vineyard" width="144" height="60" /></a>

We turned up, got issued a uniform of tee-shirt and barman's apron and started serving. It was odd pouring wine without having a glass myself, but as the afternoon progressed and got ever busier, that sensation passed. The currency in use was tokens that the punters had to buy from 'banks', with all the quality and appearance of Monopoly money. I soon found myself repeatedly emptying my apron pocket of wads of 'cash', the event being well attended despite the mediocre weather.

We had a break mid-afternoon as the demand for wine seemed to ease and took the opportunity to check out the events at neighbouring vineyards. We returned to find business had picked up and we carried on serving until late afternoon, watched the last hour of the day's live performance, then adjourned to the barbecue.

While we didn't have any unseemly behaviour to deal with, as we drove home the village was littered with groups of people who had <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/4370489/Toasters-soggy-but-still-cheerful" target="_blank">clearly enjoyed themselves</a>.
