It's been some time since we <a title="An Acquired Taste" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/an-acquired-taste/">planted the feijoas</a> which, despite being wind-hardy, took some damage from strong winds and risked being overwhelmed by weeds. Now, over two years later and benefiting from a <a href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/fencing-more-to-it-than-meets-the-eye/">proper wind break</a> and a <a href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/10/19/barking-mad/">mulch of bark</a>, they're looking in good health.

It's the time of year that they flower in preparation for fruiting and while I'm more interested in the fruit than the flower, it's hard not to be impressed by the quietly spectacular display the feijoas put on.
