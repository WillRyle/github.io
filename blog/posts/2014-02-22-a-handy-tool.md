After being mildly chastised by Doug for the state of the ride-on mower after he had serviced it, I thought I'd better improve my plant maintenance regime. One perennial problem is cleaning the underside of the mower after use. Wet grass sticks to the cutters and guard which can lead to corrosion.

Turning to the ever-useful <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz" target="_blank">TradeMe</a> web site I found the answer.

It's called 'Ezy-Up', a jack specifically for ride-ons that tilts them to one side allowing access to the underneath. Like all good ideas, it's simple and easy to use.

A few minutes after these photos were taken, an earthquake took place - it was a bit disconcerting to watch the ride-on rock backwards and forwards on the jack without any intervention from me and I stood clear in case the thing fell off. I guess the Ezy-Up is now earthquake tested, at least to 4.7 magnitude.
