Regular readers will recall the construction of the <a title="Job Done" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/job-done/">patio</a>, which involved mini diggers and large trucks with man-sized quantities of concrete. The finishing touches to this were applied today. After allowing a period of drying - prolonged by the persistent wet weather - the concrete was sealed to maintain its new-look finish. The result is a stain resistant,  semi-gloss finish that is non-slip and clean. With today's sun it's pleasantly warm under bare foot in the evening.
