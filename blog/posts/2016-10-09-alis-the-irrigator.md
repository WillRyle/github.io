Regular readers of this blog - I know there are a few - will be familiar with our struggles to water the veggie garden and the <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/irrigation/" target="_blank">assorted</a> <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2015/11/15/irrigator-mark-two/" target="_blank">contraptions</a> I've devised to reduce the time this takes while increasing the efficiency of water use. The Mark2 device based on a mobility scooter worked well last season and showed great promise in being able to be automated. I've not been idle over our Winter and have done much reading up on automation, electronics and the means to build a coherent system to provide control of the device. The work so far has resulted in a working proof-of-concept, if not in an actual working irrigator - read on if you want to find out what ALIS means...

The problem is how to save time watering an extensive veggie garden arranged in rows of about 3.5 metres over a length of about 40 metres. The Mark2 manually driven, scooter based irrigator helped enormously last season, the challenge now is to automate the scooter such that no human intervention is required. To do this, it will need to motor from one row of veggies to the next, irrigating each for a pre-determined length of time. There are a number of issues in just doing this - stopping in line with a row, turning on the water and waiting a suitable period then moving on to repeat the process for other rows, then returning to the start point ready for the next 'Irrigation Run'.

Having discovered what is necessary, it's also relevant to determine when to do it. A simple timer-based system won't suffice as it may be watering the garden when it has just rained. Similarly, it's a waste of water to irrigate when rain is forecast. Our system will have to know when to turn on the tap, not just where to put the water.

Fortunately, my day job puts me in touch with technologies that deal with situations like this - the Internet of Things (IoT) - which allows the control of remote devices and analyses the data that they generate. Our system will be autonomous, checking the weather forecast and current conditions to determine the need to irrigate the line of veggie rows. It will be an Autonomous Linear Irrigation System - ALIS. More posts will describe how it will work in detail, meanwhile we await the completion of the <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/building-again/" target="_blank">garage</a> to give us room to engineer a working solution. In the interim, there's work to be done designing the transition from a bench-top proof of concept to working prototype.
