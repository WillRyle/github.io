Enduring the short days and bad weather of Winter was getting wearisome and a reminder of how, when in the Northern hemisphere, Christmas comes along and lifts the gloom. At Friday drinks the other week I suggested to friends a mid-winter party to do the same for us. In no time plans were hatched and tasks delegated - we were to host the event at New Bolton.

It was a full-on Christmas feast, a multi-course event taking hours to complete. From the home-made soup for starters, through turkey and all the trimmings, Christmas pudding, mulled wine to the Port and Stilton, a truly splendid repast.

With mood-setting Christmas music, lights, table decorations and an airing of the Christmas favourite film "The African Queen", it really did feel like Christmas.<a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/midwinter-party-003.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-1666 alignnone" alt="Midwinter Party 003" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/midwinter-party-003.jpg?w=640" width="640" height="480" /></a>
