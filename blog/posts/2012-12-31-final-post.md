It's been a busy holiday for us and Neale, the fencer. He's just fixed the final post of the front fence today, assisted by yours truly on the concrete mixer.

Yesterday, the post hole borer was put to work and made short work of doing what it does best. Unfortunately, rain stopped play, so we didn't get as much done as hoped, hence today's follow-up.

The next stage is fitting the rails, which will doubtless involve much sawing and hammering. With luck the front fence will be finished before we go back to work next Monday.

Thoughts are already turning to the next fence. At about 100 metres, this is nearly twice the length of the front. Neale plans to get on to this in January, so there's more organising of materials to do by then.

As if this wasn't enough, We've been busy making the framework for the new shed. Each wall is made as a panel, more of which when we start fixing them together.
