A good night's sleep was spoiled on Thursday evening / Friday morning when at precisely 2.19am the cottage we're renting gave a distinct thump, waking me from my slumber. We've experienced enough of this type of incident to know it was an earthquake - they're quite distinct from the normal buffeting the house endures during gusty weather - and sure enough, <a href="http://www.geonet.org.nz" target="_blank">GeoNet</a> - who keep a count of these things - reported a <a href="http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/quakes/3473252g.html" target="_blank">4.7 magnitude quake</a> 30km deep centred around a point 20km west of Featherston.

If you care to peruse their website's page of <a href="http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/quakes/recent_quakes.html" target="_blank">recent quakes</a>, you'll notice the large number of events, mostly minor and unfelt by many. What is noteworthy though, is the frequency of quakes around the Lyttleton &amp; Christchurch area, reflecting the near continuous seismic activity since the first Christchurch earthquake in September and continuing as aftershocks to the latest disaster there last week.

We're about 220 miles from Christchurch and <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/4730722/No-big-Wellington-quake-coming-seismologist" target="_blank">are told</a> the recent quakes in the Wellington area are not seismologically connected to those events. That doesn't mean that the 'Big One' won't hit Welly tomorrow, but I think the duty seismologist in that report has made himself a hostage to fortune, as people are certain to take his remarks as some assurance that North Island hasn't got its own <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake?label=Christchurch+quake" target="_blank">Christchurch</a> event coming.
