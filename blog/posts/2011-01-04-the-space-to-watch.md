It was a hot day in the Wairarapa today, with Masterton the warmest place in the country at 31Â°C. Undaunted, we set of to walk to the summit of Featherston Domain, a country park on the edge of town.

From this vantage point, we were able to survey the entire area and naturally, our eyes were drawn to our own bit of real estate, outlined in orange. (click for a larger image)
