It's been wet and windy since Friday as a weather system brought chaos to New Zealand. We've had bouts of strong wind and heavy rain. On Saturday a hailstorm had marble-sized hailstones bouncing off the grass. There was thunder and lightning and more wind.

Across the other side of the country from us on the Kapiti Coast, a tornado did what tornadoes do, pulling down trees on houses and <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/5264370/Tornado-tosses-van-30m" target="_blank">tossed a van - with driver still inside - about 30m</a>. Sunday morning saw a lull in the rain, allowing normal activities to resume. For some of our neighbours this involved mowing the grass, which I thought an odd choice. Later on the rain resumed and persisted all night and into Monday morning, accompanied by strong winds with the odd flash of lightning.

On the positive side, the ski resorts got some much needed snow, but unfortunately for some it was <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/new-zealand/5265108/Heavy-snow-closes-skifields" target="_blank">too much</a> and forced them to close.

It's not over yet though, with a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/5264366/Tornado-warning-for-North-Island" target="_blank">tornado warning</a> in place for North Island and gale force winds expected.
