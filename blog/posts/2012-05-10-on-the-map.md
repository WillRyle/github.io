Taking a look at New Bolton in Google Maps recently, I switched to Satellite view and was surprised to see the aerial photo for our part of the world has been updated.

<a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/newbolton-aerial.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1088" title="New Bolton from the air" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/newbolton-aerial.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="506" /></a>

The image shows the house, driveway, car and pump house quite clearly and judging from the state of the boundaries is likely to have been taken some time after the <a title="Digger" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/digger/">tree stumps were removed</a> and the builder's spoil heap carted away.
