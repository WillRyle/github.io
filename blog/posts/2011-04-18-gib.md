Progress on the build continues inside. The hot water tank appeared and then disappeared to its new home up in the loft. Shortly after, a large quantity of plasterboard (known locally as gib) and insulation (pink batts) was delivered.

Over the course of the week these have also been installed, with the ceiling now completely boarded.

Next to arrive was another large delivery of plasterboard and more insulation, which will doubtless find its way onto the walls this week. This will allow us to see the internal room layout in a way that see-through studding doesn't permit.

Outside, we carried on with clearing the boundaries, working near the house so that we could take cover if the expected rain materialised.

With both corners of the section cleared along the diagonal, a good view of what will double up as the archery range is now evident.<a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ne-boundary-019.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-587 alignnone" title="Same diagonal from opposite end" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ne-boundary-019.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

According to the map measuring tool, the diagonal measures 110+ yards, enough to get in a York Â round.
