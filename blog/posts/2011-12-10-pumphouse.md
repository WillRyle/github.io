There's been steady progress with the pool since the arrival of the parts from the U.S. though the 'man flu' slowed me down somewhat.

The pump house is taking shape. Following a discussion with the electrician the location of the electrical equipment was determined and all is ready for his return visit to make the connections.

The next job here is making the plumbing connections and routing the pipework through to the pool.

On the pool itself the wood receiver coping is now installed and awaits the attentions of the joiner who is making the coping. Next job for me will be fitting the insulation to the pool's sides.
