With being busy with build, house and garden over the last 18 months or so, we've not had a road trip for some time, something we finally managed to put right. Leaving the never-ending list of things to do behind us, we packed up the van (also known as the Tent On Wheels) and headed North.

During our previous excursions around North Island, we learnt about the Forgotten World Highway. There are several 'themed' highways - "Thermal Explorer", "Pacific Coast", "Twin Coast Discovery" etc, - which we've travelled, at least in part, on earlier trips but the isolation of Forgotten World demands special attention and we left it for a later date. That later date was this week.

We motored up through Wairarapa and called in at <a href="http://www.ontargetarchery.co.nz/" target="_blank">On Target Archery </a>in Palmerston North to get Denise sorted with some arrows before calling it a day in Wanganui. An early start and a refuel saw us at the Pioneer Village, just outside Stratford. We spent a good couple of hours wandering through the old buildings that had been relocated from their original sites and arranged to create a village indicative of pioneer times.

State Highway 43, to use its formal designation, runs the 150km from Stratford in the South to Taumarunui in the North. It boasts not a single petrol station and a 12km section hasn't earned the right to tarmac.

The map shows townships dotted along its length, which are easily missed if you blink on the way through them. The largest - by a small margin - is Whangamomona. This is distinguished by having a <a href="http://www.whangamomonahotel.co.nz/" target="_blank">hotel</a> and being the independent <a href="http://www.whangamomonahotel.co.nz/acat.html" target="_blank">Republic of Whangamomona</a>, a state declared by the inhabitants after being unimpressed by the results of a local government reorganisation in 1988.

The sparsely populated countryside focuses attention on nature's handiwork and there's plenty of that to see.
