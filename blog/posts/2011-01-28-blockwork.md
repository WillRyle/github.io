The inner walls are the pool's in-ground and deep area sections.

Conduits from the in-ground section will run to the equipment shed. There are four conduits, one each for flow and return pipes for the water quality system and hydrotherapy jets. The rectangular conduit will allow the hydraulic hoses and other ancillary pipes and cables to run from poolside to equipment shed. Another pipe will be the drain to clear any spillage or leakage.

The full outline of the house is now clearly visible. The next stage is back-filling the blocks then adding concrete up to floor level.
