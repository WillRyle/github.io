Another beer advert, another good laugh. Especially after a few..err...beers.

Speights is a brewery on South Island and has been running a series of 'Southern Man' ads where the hero is hard working, straight talking and from South Island.

I thought the music for this ad was just some made up nonsense until I came across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0inlNHI0V44" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvCFIposH_g" target="_blank">this</a> on youtube. <a href="http://www.spookymen.com.au/" target="_blank">Spooky</a>.
