After an epic sea journey from Philadelphia, USA through the Panama Canal and across the emptiness of the Pacific Ocean, our crate of spares from Endless Pools arrived by road at New Bolton.

It was unceremoniously dumped outside the pool room door and I adjourned for a lie down in a dark room, suddenly overcome by the huge cost of it all.

The arrival of the parts was the trigger for me to book a week's leave, with the intention of making good progress on the installation. Fate had other ideas though, and no sooner had I finished work on Friday than the tell-tale symptoms of a cold made themselves felt. This has seriously limited my productivity and I've focused on tasks that are relatively mundane, not wanting to make a slip-up that could set us back weeks.

With luck this dose of 'man-flu' as Denise insists on calling it, will have run its course soon, allowing better progress to be made.
