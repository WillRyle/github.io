It's over 5 years since we completed the pool installation and had <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/first-swim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first swim</a>. This is only significant because 5 years is the Endless Pool service interval, at which a major overhaul is carried out and we took extra holiday around the Easter break to commence work.

We'd ordered the necessary replacement parts months ago with the intention of doing the work in Spring, but events overtook us so we deferred it to the Autumn.

The overhaul involves replacing the butyl liner, swim current propeller and hydraulic motor on the basis that 5 years in chlorinated water is long enough for these key components. We drained down the pool and removed the stainless steel work and liner over the Easter weekend and assessed the state of the galvanised panels.

These required some work to clean the rust from them where water from an earlier leak had got behind and couldn't get out. With the rust removed and treated we painted the panels with several coats of marine paint then turned our attention to the concrete floor which was cleaned and painted.We took the opportunity to sand and re-varnish the coping giving it another 3 coats of yacht varnish.

We were then able to start putting it all back together, fitting the foam underlay before un-boxing the new liner. This was different from the plain blue ones we've had before, having a mosaic pattern around the water line. It was also a struggle to fit compared to previous ones, but we refused to hurry the job and make a mess of it, taking our time to get it right.

We were finally able to start filling with water and reinstall the stainless steel work, the swim current being fitted with its new propeller, hydraulic hoses and motor. With the pool full there were a number of very small leaks that were fixed by tightening the through-wall connections. A check of the swim current in operation showed no hydraulic leaks and that I'd got the pressure and return hoses the right way round, so we switched on the heater and let it warm the water. We adjusted the water hardness, alkalinity and PH during the week, before fitting the final stainless steel panels in the corners this morning. Denise joined me for first swim in what is effectively a new pool and good for another 5 years.
