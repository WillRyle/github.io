It's been some time since the great <a title="Sweet Corn" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/12/29/sweet-corn/">sweet corn planting epic</a> came to an end and, following the principle that you reap what you sow, we've been gathering the fruits - or in this case, the corn - of our labours.

Sweet corn is a crop that needs cooking as soon as possible after picking, otherwise the sweetness turns to starch. There's then the issue of de-kerning the cobs. Clearly there's more work than two can reasonably handle if a large crop is to be processed successfully. <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/tractortillershed-040.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1615" alt="Tractor;Tiller;Shed 040" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/tractortillershed-040.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a>

The solution was to host a sweet corn festival, inviting friends over to help pick and process the corn. In addition, each participant could show case their favourite sweet corn recipe, giving us a range of tasty treats to try.

The events - we've had two on consecutive weekends - have been an unqualified success, resulting in delicious food, kilos of corn in the freezer and jars of sweet corn relish in the larder.

After picking a good quantity of cobs - each is stripped of its outer leaves in the garden - the cobs are microwaved to cook them fast and keep their juicy sweetness. They are then stripped of their remaining leaves and de-kerned by cutting down the cob. This was the tricky bit - too shallow a cut bursts the kernel, too deep will leave the cob attached to the kernels. We soon accumulated enough kernels to start cooking.

The sharp knives were put away and the wine cellar opened for business as we set about preparing the ingredients.
