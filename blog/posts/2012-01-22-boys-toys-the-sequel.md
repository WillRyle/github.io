After the acquisition of the <a title="Boy’s Toys" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/12/25/boys-toys/">ride-on mower</a> just before Christmas, we now have an addition to the growing array of engine-driven garden machinery cluttering the grounds of New Bolton.

The item in question is a Kubota walk-behind tractor. This is no trifling garden cultivator, but a diesel engined tiller festooned with gears and clutches.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tiller-003.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970" title="Tiller 003" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tiller-003.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
The thing boasts 6 forward gears and 2 reverse and the tiller has high and low ratios. Steering is achieved by de-clutching using the levers on the handlebars. This stops the wheel on that side from turning so the opposite wheel turns the hoe in the required direction.

The tines turn in the direction of travel and have a slicing action. Several passes over the same ground are necessary to get to any depth in the long neglected soil, but it still saves considerable labour.

The rotary hoe unit can be detached and swapped out for other devices, though there are no others supplied with our purchase. Other accessories include a seat and towing attachments to allow trailers and the like to be drawn. Unfortunately we don't have a user's manual, so finding out what it's capable of is a matter of research.
