While the veggie gardens gave a somewhat <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2018/04/01/harvest-time-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lacklustre</a> performance this year, our fruit trees have excelled themselves.

The fig tree produced loads of figs, but our attempts to keep the birds off by covering the tree in netting until they ripened fully were thwarted by strong winds which blew the protection off - several times - so we conceded defeat until we come up with a better idea.

The feijoas did their usual trick of dropping large quantities of fruit in a short period and we gathered several large bucket loads and saved the best in the garage while we worked out what to do with them. Of all the options we considered, my favourite was the feijoa cider - simple to make, not too much labour required and fairly quick results. After a trip to a local homebrew shop to obtain some essential equipment, we had about 6kg of fruit chopped up and in a tub of water, where they steeped for a week. The mash was strained into another container and 2kg of sugar and 6 lemons were added. After a couple of days it was obvious fermentation was underway, so the mixture was strained into sterilised PET bottles. We're about a week away from first tasting - I just hope it doesn't come out too sweet and that the bottles can handle the pressure of fermentation which is still ongoing.

Our other top producer was the lime bush. We were going to leave them on the tree until they fell off on their own accord, but it seems that picking them while they're green is better. Denise duly set to the task and returned struggling under the weight of a large bucket full of limes. Some have been dished out to friends, co-workers and neighbours, but Denise has made two batches of lime pickle - something we struggle to find in NZ and a curry just isn't the same without it. We are getting low on the last lot of lime pickle, so hopefully the next batch will be ready in time. Another success for the limes is the homemade lime &amp; ginger marmalade that Denise made several jars of. This has proved a hit with all who have tasted it and while the marmalade is half sugar, the lime means it isn't as sugary-sweet as regular fruit jams.

Despite all the fruit used, we still have a good quantity of feijoas and limes left. The limes will keep and so get used over time, as for the feijoas when I've tasted the cider I'll make another batch, reducing the sugar content if it turns out too sweet. With the rain largely shutting down outside work - it's barely stopped raining for the last three weeks - we've made good use of our time and the workshop's 'clean bench' by processing the produce.
