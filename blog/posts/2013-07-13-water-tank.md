We're in the depths of a New Zealand winter, where cold, wet and mostly dark is normal. The ground is too wet to work, strong winds drive the rain horizontally. It's natural to avoid outside jobs, stay indoors and put another log on the fire.

During a relatively fine spell on Monday and Tuesday this week, Steve The Plumber was on site installing a new rainwater tank. It's common for Kiwi homes that are off mains water to collect rainwater from the roof and pipe it into storage tanks, then filter and pump it into the house.

A water tank has been on our plans from the outset and the house's guttering and down pipes were configured to give maximum catchment that up to now had gone into a soak pit. Steve's job was to route the water from the house to the tank, with the tank overflow being directed into the soak.

Our installation is intended for irrigation use, but will also serve as an emergency water supply if a big earthquake disrupts the <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tank-003.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1669" alt="Tank 003" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tank-003.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a>mains. The tank has a capacity of 25,000 litres with a diameter of 3.5 metres. It is 3 metres tall, but has been installed partially in-ground to reduce its height. The tank water will be piped to a pump - appropriately enough in the pump house with the pool equipment - and will send water down a network of pipes that Steve has added to give us three outlets. One of these is attached to the shed to cover the crop area, the other two are on each side boundary and will serve the vegetable garden and the yet-to-be-planted orchard.

A logistics problem has meant that the pump is not yet fitted, but since the tank was connected to the house's guttering 48mm of rain have fallen and the process of filling the tank is well under way. There will be plenty of rainfall before Summer and by the time the hot weather arrives we'll have a full tank.
