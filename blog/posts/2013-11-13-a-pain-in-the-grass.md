Some evening tractor work today, this time with the chain harrow attached. There's a slight improvement but, despite our efforts carting the dead grass off the ground over the weekend, there's still a lot out there.

This is a problem, as it gets in the way of levelling irons and chain harrow and prevents the preparation of a good seed bed. It looks like there'll be more raking, but this time with some modification to the rake attachment to get the smaller lumps off.

It'll be time-consuming hard work, but short of a good Featherston wind to blow the stuff away, it's all we've got.
