The keen-eyed reader may have spotted some equipment in use <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2018/04/08/tree-planting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently</a> that is new - at least to us.<!--more--><img class="  wp-image-2513 alignleft" style="outline:#777777 solid 1px;height:301px;text-align:left;color:#3d596d;text-transform:none;text-indent:0;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;word-spacing:0;white-space:normal;max-width:680px;orphans:2;background-color:transparent;" src="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/trailer.jpg" alt="trailer" width="401" height="502" />

This is a handy trailer for use behind the ride-on mowers. Spotted during a recent visit to handy neighbour Doug, I immediately saw its potential and Doug was happy to part with it. The home-built trailer uses golf cart wheels and its high sides allow plenty of material to be loaded, though I wouldn't trust it to carry any serious weight. It has proved very handy during today's tree planting carting stuff about.

This is one of Doug's creations made up from salvaged components in the traditional Kiwi way. Its large tank and belt driven compressor make available a good supply of high-pressure air, opening up a new world of power tools. A tyre inflator was the first acquisition and I've been able to revive my 'windy' air drill - bought years ago when I was still 'on the tools' - which has been unused for too long. In the pipeline are a blow gun, engine-cleaning gun and spray gun, which will be of great help during the upcoming servicing and renovation of Gus, the little grey Fergie.
