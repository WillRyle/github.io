<a href="http://www.feijoa.org.nz/" target="_blank">Feijoas</a>. They're an acquired taste. They're also evergreen and wind-hardy, so ideal as a fruit-bearing wind break and that's how we're planning on using them. Our first of these plants went in today.

We marked out the second of our veggie patches. We plan a series of these, each divided by some form of fruit tree or bush, trained along supporting wires and protected by wind-break mesh. The feijoas were on special offer from a grower at the Petone fair and planted 2 metres apart the five plants will fit splendidly along the edge of the new patch.

We're harvesting potatoes and have planted winter brassicas - cauliflower, cabbage, brussel sprouts, broccoli - and have added onions with leeks yet to plant out. We've also acquired some strawberry plants, while round the back of the house a row of beans struggles to gain height.

We were greatly aided in our work today by the tiller, which made short work of turning over the ground. Next to do in this area is fix posts and wires to train the plants against and put the tiller to work on the rest of the patch in preparation for planting.
