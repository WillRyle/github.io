We've had Josh with us for a week now and it's been interesting and entertaining, sometimes at the same time.

<!--more-->

What we have learned so far:
<ul>
	<li>He doesn't drink much - Like a lot of grazing animals they don't need much water and he's only taken the odd sip from his bucket.</li>
	<li>He doesn't eat much - He's made a modest impression on the grass within range of his tether, but there's still plenty left.</li>
	<li>Approaching him in the dark with a torch is a bad idea - He gets spooked by the light and charges about in a panic. It's kind of funny to watch, if you can suppress the worry about him hurting himself.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align:left;">He's aware of his surroundings - As his owners left our section last weekend he looked distinctly bemused, his gaze switching between their departing ute and us in apparent bewilderment.</li>
	<li style="text-align:left;">He gets bored - It can't be much fun for a herd animal without company and he's often looking in the direction of our neighbour who has a few sheep. Their occasional bleating must sound like there's a party going on in comparison. We're looking at getting some fencing organised so the sheep - who are also short of grazing - can join him in a temporary paddock and party all day.</li>
	<li style="text-align:left;">He's surprisingly strong - Yesterday he watched me depart for a neighbour's house through a gap in the fence, which must have provoked an overwhelming urge to follow me. He managed to pull the screw picket anchoring his tether clean out of the ground and gave chase, the screw became entangled in the fence and Josh, by now moving at a fair rate, simply pulled the lead clip from the tether and made his bid for freedom. Fortunately neighbours helped to catch and re-secure him in short order, the process providing some amusement for a passing motorist and allaying my fears that he was heading for the Rimutaka Hills to join the feral goats there. First priority today was obtaining a new restraint and he is now firmly secured again.</li>
</ul>
