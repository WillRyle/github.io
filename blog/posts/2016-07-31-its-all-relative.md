My meanderings about the internet yielded a site of interest <a href="http://www.thetruesize.com">http://www.thetruesize.com </a>

This interactive Google Maps application allows the user to select a country and view its area information and also drag that country on top of another part of the world to view the true size of the country relative to others.

New Zealand on the map looks like a small group of islands tucked away in the South Pacific, tiny against its nearest neighbour Australia and with no other frame of reference in the vastness of the ocean. I know NZ is somewhat larger than the UK so used the site to make a more direct comparison. Selecting NZ by entering it into the search tool, I dragged it North and positioned the Southern-most tip of South Island on the Southern-most tip of England. <a href="http://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!MTUyNTMwNjY.MTM3NTQ0MDQ*MjA2OTcyMDg(MTQ3Njg5ODY~!CONTIGUOUS_US*MTAwMjQwNzU.MjUwMjM1MTc(MTc1)MA~!IN*NTI2NDA1MQ.Nzg2MzQyMQ)MQ~!NZ*MTYwMDIxNTM.MTc1ODY4NDI)NQ" target="_blank">see here</a>

The result is quite illuminating - the Northern-most point of NZ (Cape Reinga at the tip of the long thin peninsula extending NW from North Island) finished up at about the same latitude as the Faroe Islands, Gisborne on the NE coast of North Island came in just South of Norway and Chatham Island landed somewhere West of Berlin.

Take a look at the site and pick your own true size comparison, it may challenge your geographic assumptions.
