With only one working week until we're given the keys, the big question is will it be ready in time? Take a look at the video below, taken today, to see what's left to do.

There is still a lot to do, but it's mostly relatively minor work. Oddly, the equipment shed - which has always been a low priority side-show - is now on the build's critical path. Since it was found that a pumped sewer was necessary and the best place to power the pump was from the equipment shed, the pump cannot be permanently wired until the shed is completed and its electrical sub-main installed. This shouldn't prevent us moving in, as power can be provided by an extension lead, but such an arrangement will not conform to the local authority compliance standard.

Other work outstanding includes some paint finishing, plumbing, re-fitting the internal doors when they are returned from the paint shop, external painting and fixing of rainwater down spouts. With the internal work out of the way, the carpet fitters can get to do their stuff. My bet is we'll make it on the appointed day, so I'd better organise some removal guys.
