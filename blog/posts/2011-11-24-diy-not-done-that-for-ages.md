Living in rented accommodation up until recently has allowed us to explore the country without having to divert time to those jobs around the house that always demand attention. My toolbox was left almost untouched as my DIY efforts were limited to assembling newly bought furniture or fitting NZ plugs to British electrical appliances.

After moving in to a brand new house, we had a honeymoon period where we enjoyed the novelty of 'newness' tinged with a marked reluctance to start knocking nails into pristine walls. It's a measure of how unaccustomed to DIY we've become - or just plain slothfulness - that it has taken nearly 6 months to reach for the tools and start adding our own touches to the house. This followed a trip to the new big orange shed in Masterton known as <a title="Mitre 10 Mega store web site" href="http://www.mitre10mega.co.nz/" target="_blank">Mitre 10</a> to buy materials and the weekend saw pictures hung and shelves made and fixed. Given the lack of practice, I made a reasonable job but as ever there is more to do.

This is not some odd diversion away from projects that are under way, but a remote outpost of the pool installation. The pool room is still cluttered with boxes which need to be moved to enable completion of the pool. There is nowhere to move them to, so they need to be emptied and the contents need somewhere to go, which means shelves and hanging pictures on walls. With the pool parts scheduled for delivery on Monday, time is pressing to make space for their arrival.
