An early finish at work and favourable weather combined to inspire a bit of work in the garden last Wednesday evening. I started on mowing the lawn and when Denise came home - she's now back from overseas - she joined in on her <a title="Starting a Collection" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/11/02/starting-a-collection/">newly acquired</a> machine.

As expected, two mowers are better than one and we soon had the job done. The last bit of lawn though saw things descend into a bit of a dodgem ride, the racket making neighbour Pete pop over the fence and record the event.
