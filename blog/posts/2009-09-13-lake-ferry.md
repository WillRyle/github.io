This was definitely a weekend of two halves – wet and overcast on Saturday, wall to wall sunshine on Sunday. We took advantage of the fine weather and headed off over the Rimutakas into the Wairarapa, where, after breakfast at Featherston, we headed for Lake Ferry. Lake Ferry is a one street village on the South coast of North Island, next to Lake Onoke. A breaker separates the lake from Palliser Bay and Cooke Strait. We’ve been there before, when it was wild and windy, but the contrast on this visit was marked. Calm, warm and sunny, Lake Onoke was doing a good impersonation of a rather large mill pond.

The fine weather had brought out the visitors and the pub/cafe/restaurant was doing a brisk trade.

Fishing seemed to be the main activity, with whole families of Kiwis casting their lines into the bay, while on the lake shore nets were set up.
