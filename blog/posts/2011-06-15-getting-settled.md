The pile of boxes is slightly diminished and the cupboards and drawers are slightly fuller as we gradually get organised. The painters are still struggling with awkward weather trying to finish the outside, the only job on the house remaining. Elsewhere, the driveway awaits its finishing layer of aggregate.

Taking the week off post-move allowed me to see the section at different times of day that I hadn't managed before. On one crisp and clear morning, the sun rise lighting up the Rimutakas was so quietly spectacular I was moved to reach for the camera and record the occasion.

That's quite a view from the front porch, but fairly standard for rural Wairarapa.

At the back of the house it's clear the build is coming to an end as the site cabin, in the form of the ubiquitous shipping container, has been removed. We've also gained a satellite dish, discreetly placed on the rear. The pile of dirt will get bulldozed about the site until we've lost it.
