Last Tuesday was a night like any other Winter's night in the Wairarapa. Dark, wet and not too warm ;)

New Bolton was the picture of domestic tranquility - warmed by a good fire, I was leaned back in my "Lazy Boy" chair, which swivels, reclines and rocks. A glass of Merlot in one hand and the phone in the other, I was chatting to Mum in England when I noticed that the chair was rocking of its own accord.

A quick check with Denise confirmed my initial thought that this was an earthquake and mindful of Mum on the phone, I let her know what was happening. The rocking persisted for a good while - 30 to 60 seconds, not the <a title="Shaky Office and Cows on the Line" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/shaky-office-and-cows-on-the-line/">short jolts </a>that we've <a href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/bump-in-the-night/">had in the past</a> - but I am glad to report that no wine was spilled or otherwise wasted. It turns out that the quake was a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/7234165/Claims-roll-in-after-magnitude-7-quake" target="_blank">significant 7.0</a> and felt extensively through New Zealand, but being deep caused little damage.

With the quake the topic of conversation at work the next day, I heard tales of rattling crockery, people making for the safety of doorways and considering the move to higher ground in case a tsunami rolled in. Clearly, Wellington felt it more than we did.
