After much planning, exploring options, costing different ideas and generally spending a deal of time and effort on finding the most cost-efficient and affordable build, construction of our garage/workshop is well underway.

<!--more-->

The final design is a two-bay garage with attached workshop area in an 'L' shape. The workshop features its own sectional door to allow garden machinery to be brought in for servicing. Our trusty Toyota bus will finally find shelter from the paint-fading Wairarapa sun in one of the two bays and the other will house Gus the Ferguson tractor as it undergoes some much-needed renovation.

The plan is 70 sq metres (700 sq feet) and will allow for extensive workbenches and tool storage and house other sundry equipment such as bicycles. Plenty of lighting and an abundance of power points will help in equipment servicing, gadget building and Denise's stained glass making. All the walls and ceiling will be insulated and lined, windows are double glazed and the sectional doors are pre-insulated, making conditions inside bearable in Wairarapa's hot summers and frosty winters.

With the building completed - an event that's still some weeks away - there will be more work to do in extending the driveway to allow access to the garage and creating a 'flow' to and from the house.
