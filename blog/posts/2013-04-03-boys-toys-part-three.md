In the Spring we <a title="The Best LaidÂ Plans" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/the-best-laid-plans/">reported</a> our frustration at getting the section levelled and re-seeded. We resolved to get in touch with our ploughing contact in the Autumn to get the job done then. A couple of weekends ago I rang him again only to be told he's still unavailable.

I chased down two other leads to be stymied at each of them. With time marching on, action was needed soon if we were to stand a chance of getting the work done this season. I knew I could turn the ground over with our revamped tiller, it was getting it levelled that was the problem, until I spotted something for sale on <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz" target="_blank">Trade Me</a> and the vendor was - literally - round the corner.

Now, hopefully, we'll make some progress.
