Back from our holiday, we slid effortlessly into the working routine and it soon felt like we hadn't been away. The weather has stopped us from getting the garden ready as early as we would have liked, but a happy convergence of weekend, inclination and an end to the rain has allowed us to get on with outdoor jobs.

The weed-covered veggie plots were put through a process that saw them ready for planting in just two weekends. In the first stage of the process, the line trimmer is used to cut down the weeds. Next up, an optional application of lime, rapidly followed by the big tiller to turn the ground over. Levelling is done by manually raking the smaller plots, but Gus the Fergie, equipped with the chain harrow, was started up for the first time in a while to clear the detritus and level the rear crop area.

In addition to the ground work, the lawns got mowed and the edges around the fence trimmed, making the place look presentable after the rigours of the winter. By way of a finale, we managed to plant the early crop potatoes.

It was hard work, but to sooth our aches we retired to the pool and relaxed with fizzy wine thinking about how hard it would have been without the machinery to help us. Next up, the planting.
