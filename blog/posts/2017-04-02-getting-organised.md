Following last year's <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2016/05/14/endless-summer/" target="_blank">Endless Summer</a>, this Summer - following a very wet Spring - has been somewhat changeable. The other weekend was a case in point with torrential rain on Saturday, a hot Sunday followed by a wet evening.

The positive side of this is that the demand for manual watering is reduced, which is just as well as I've not made as much progress with <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/alis-the-irrigator/">ALIS the Irrigator</a> as I'd hoped, given the other work on the garage. As we get more organised in the workshop though, I've done some preliminary investigation on how to convert the mobility scooter into an autonomous watering bot and have a good idea of how to proceed. I've been researching what components are needed and where to get them from and so have been busy on <a href="http://trademe.co.nz" target="_blank">TradeMe</a>.

The driveway is now in place following a visit from Tim, who removed several truckloads of spoil and deposited even more aggregate. The final job to do on the driveway is compacting all the stone into a firm base, on which I've made a start with Tim's loaned plate whacker, but plan on finishing with a larger vibrating roller. We were finally able to put van and tractor inside the garage, seven months after construction started, another plan that has come together.
