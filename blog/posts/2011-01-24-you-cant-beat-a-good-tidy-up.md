The relentless rain, brought to us courtesy of a sub-tropical storm, did in fact relent today in the early afternoon. We took the opportunity to make up for lost time and set about continuing the clearing of the detritus from the North East boundary. <!--more-->

This is adjacent to properties whose owners have used our previously vacant section as a tip for garden waste. We had already made a start on this in December (see picture at top left), but clearly there's a lot more to do. Today's effort, added to that of Saturday's, shows a noticeable improvement, with a lot of stumps now exposed and ready for removal and a significantly larger pile of garden and household waste. <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/garden-008.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-276 alignright" title="North East Boundary 3" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/garden-008.jpg" alt="" width="346" height="259" /></a>

We've probably cleared about half the length of this boundary now and have made a number of good contacts for tree stump removal and grass cutting. With all the rain we've had the grass keeps on growing and the stumps keep sprouting new growth. As we uncover the stumps we cut off any growth and remove the bark in an attempt to at least delay re-growth until such time as we get their removal organised. One of our new contacts has a ride-on lawnmower and is keen to see how it performs on our section as opposed to the more manicured areas he already takes care of.
