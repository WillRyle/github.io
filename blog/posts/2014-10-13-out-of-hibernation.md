October is the official start of Spring, but so far had been decidedly un-Spring like, with low temperatures. Our first foray into the garden was rudely terminated by a hailstorm that rattled down for a good hour.

Last weekend saw a change for the better and good progress was made in preparations for sowing this season's vegetable crop.

After that the tractor was brought out of hibernation, only complaining briefly about being started after so long idle, and coupled to the chain harrow to spread the tilled compost. Another pass with the tiller was deemed necessary before the ground looked ready to be planted. It will get another run over with the chain harrow before the seed goes in.

With the crop area at the rear done, the veggie plots got the tiller's attention.

The next delivery will be timber to create an edging to contain the bark.
