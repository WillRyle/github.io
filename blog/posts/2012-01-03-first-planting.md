We've had the section for over a year now and in that time we've had <a title="Haymaking" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2010/12/05/haymaking/">hay made</a>, grass cut, <a title="Digger" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/digger/">stumps removed</a> and <a title="Hoe HoeÂ Hoe" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/12/24/hoe-hoe-hoe/">soil turned over</a>. Now at last, after drawing up our plans for the garden and marking them out with peg and line, the first new plants have gone in the ground.

Our plan is to put the long diagonal of the section to lawn, which will extend to the house. The other side will be divided into vegetable plots at right angles to the diagonal. Each plot will be separated from its neighbour by a line of fruit bushes trained along a wire fence.

Today's work involved the installation of posts and wire, the planting of six fruit bushes and fitting wind-break mesh to give some protection to the bushes and the vegetables that will ultimately grow down wind.

In area, this plot is not much smaller than what we had to work with in England, but looking at the bigger picture shows that we've only taken the tiniest possible start and have a long way to go to make our plans come to fruition.
