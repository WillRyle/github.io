...From Steve the Builder is that this week will see the weatherboard continuing to be added. The roofers are checking out the weather forecast and may be on site next week.

The weather has turned windy all over North Island with the strong gusts jolting the cottage we're in and spoiling our beauty sleep.

Meanwhile, my web cam server is experiencing technical difficulties and now complains with long beeping sounds at start up. It's clearly not happy, so I've switched to a standby machine which can be viewed <a href="http://www.ryle.co.uk" target="_blank">here</a>. It's worth a look if only because it's pointed at a different part of the garden.
