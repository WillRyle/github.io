New Zealand is home to a number of assorted 'extreme' sports and is famous for its bungee jumping. <a title="Flying Foxy Ladies" href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/flying-foxy-ladies/">Denise and Marie's flying fox stunt</a> was typical of the madness that afflicts tourists when they come to the country. On the water, <a title="Jet Boat" href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/jet-boat/">our jet boat ride</a> was huge fun and didn't involve flying without the benefit of aerodynamics, which is always a positive in my view.

It's natural enough that the locals take to these sports too and I guess if you're a jet boat operator and the day job doesn't let you have enough fun, then building a small jet boat and racing against others is a logical thing to do. For some years now, the <a href="http://jetsprint.co.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Jet Sprint Association</a> has held competitions around the country and one of the venues is Featherston, at the <a href="http://www.tauherenikau.co.nz/" target="_blank">Tauherenikau Racecourse</a> just outside the town. This is one event I've always managed to miss, but with neighbour Pete a regular spectator and keen to go again, I went along too...

The first thing that struck me was how small the course was, which would probably fit in a football field. It was a series of water filled ditches that twisted about the land leaving a series of islands. The race was a timed circuit, one boat at a time, where the aim was to navigate the series of waterways in a specific sequence.

The boats are small, aluminium hulled affairs with large powerful engines. The 'entry level' class, known as 400, have a maximum permissible power rating of 500hp. The 'Superboat' class has no upper power limit but 1,000hp was typical with some rated at 1,500hp.

All this power drives a pump, which sucks in water through a scoop under the boat and sends it in a jet at the back, hence 'jet boat'. The jet nozzle is steerable and is used to change direction, where the more severe manoeuvres can impose 8g of lateral force.

The boats have a crew of two, pilot and navigator, the navigator being responsible for directing the pilot around the course in the correct sequence. Some crews got lost - given the speeds involved this is quite understandable - but as long as the navigator got the boat back on track and the course was completed in the correct order, the only penalty was the extra time it took the crew to recover the mistake. Other errors of judgement weren't forgiven. Several craft misjudged bends and found themselves parked on an island or otherwise out of the water and had to be rescued by teams of marshalls positioned around the course.

At a break in the racing we wandered around the boats and chatted to some of the crew. Many participants were women and there was at least one all woman crew. They compete on equal footing with the mixed and male crews. With about fifty boats present, this was an event that's taken seriously and thoroughly enjoyed by crew and spectators alike.
