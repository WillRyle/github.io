We're often told that caging hens is a bad thing. Given little room to move and denied the three basic chook needs - perching, scratching and nesting - it takes a hard heart to agree that such conditions justify the cheap eggs produced. So when are caged hens a good idea?

Well, if the cage measures 3x6 metres and is 2 metres high at the ridge, maybe it's worth considering. Seeing the local sparrow population help itself to the chook food and leave only parasites behind had us thinking of a solution which presented itself on the ever handy Trade Me web site. Duly obtained, assembled and installed, the chooks seem quite happy in their new surroundings. With the door to the cage left open, they can wander within the extended confines of the chook fence as before and we think this is a better solution than allowing them total free range and certainly more amenable to all than battery cages.
