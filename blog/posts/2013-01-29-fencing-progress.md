A productive week for Neale saw the pile of posts and rails assembled into a smart-looking fence.

This run extends about 100 metres along the South East boundary. The opening is to allow access to an easement and will be closed by a hurdle - a removable section of fence.Another length of fencing - about 25 metres - is required to complete the job. There then remains just the gates, for which I have a local contact.
