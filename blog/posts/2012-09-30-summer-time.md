With the clocks going forward this weekend, Summer is here officially at least. We're now GMT + 13 and in the brief period of being 12 hours ahead of England until the clocks there go back.

As we wait for Steve and his Clydesdales to turn up for the great New Bolton ploughing and re-seeding epic, work continues about the place. We've planted the first early potatoes and the second earlies went in today.

Last weekend I borrowed Trev's vibrating roller and compacted the driveway, still loose after the last stone was added. It's a machine I've never used before and - ordinarily - an odd activity for the weekend, but this is New Zealand and DIY here is elevated to a new level. (A neighbour was clearing and remodelling his back yard at the same time, which involved the use of a mini-digger and a gang of mates.)

Amongst our many ideas for the section is a plan to install a 25,000 litre water tank to harvest rainwater from the house roof. This would supply water for the garden during the hot and dry Wairarapa summer. Like many other ideas, it is on hold pending other work, but I recently got the opportunity of acquiring two 1,000 litre tanks which would make ideal water butts in the interim.

After a quick trip over the hill, trailer in tow, the tanks were retrieved. Another trip to the Big Orange Shed for guttering supplies and some deft work with an electric screwdriver saw the pump house's roof draining into a new gutter and thence into tank. All we need now is some rain to fill it. The second tank will be fitted in a similar manner to the yet-to-be-built shed.
