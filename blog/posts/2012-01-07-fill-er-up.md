The pool installation is now in its final stages. With the liner and stainless steel fitted, the next step is to make the through-wall connections. To do this, more water must be added to settle the liner into place. The hose is running, but it may be some time.

Friday saw the underlay fixed, where we made a functional if not aesthetically pleasing job.

This was followed by the liner, which is clipped into a liner hanger around the top of the pool the worked in to place using a mix of pushing with hands and feet and a bit of suction from the vacuum cleaner - handy for pulling the liner into place against the tank walls. <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pool-015.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-939" title="Liner fixed" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/pool-015.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>With the vacuum still running, water is added to settle the liner into position. We've made a better job of the liner than our last installation, with no wrinkles this time, but have paid the price in the time taken.

The big lump at the front of the pool was lifted in with the assistance of our kind neighbour and the rest added to form the channels which circulate the water back to the propeller. This was particularly bothersome and time-consuming, with each stainless steel piece putting up a fight by refusing to line up with its neighbour.

The final result is worth the effort though, being a neat job.
