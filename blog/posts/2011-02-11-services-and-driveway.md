Plenty of visible progress this week, but still no concrete. First to appear was the long trench to take power, phone and water to the house.

I finalised the route the driveway was to take by the simple expedient of driving the car where I wanted it to go and showing the wheel tracks to the ground works guys. Not wanting the section to be divided, it turns right after entering, then left down the long boundary to the house leaving sufficient space between it and the edge of the section to allow for planting of fruit trees.

Meanwhile, the house is now definitely ready for concrete, having acquired a damp-proof membrane and a mesh of reinforcing wire. It seems that the council insisted that minor changes to the concrete were reflected in the plans before being poured, so we wait while they are sent to the architect, the changes made and sent back to council for approval.

And it seems we've gained a power meter box and the grass has been cut. Odd what happens when your back is turned.
