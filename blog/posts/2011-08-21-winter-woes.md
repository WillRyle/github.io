The weather has been much in the news here last week, when a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5434392/Snow-storm-to-hit-Wellington-region" target="_blank">low pressure system</a> popped up from Antarctica and deposited snow in parts of New Zealand that haven't seen any white stuff for years.

Here in Featherston we didn't have enough for a snowball fight, but at higher elevations there was a good amount that closed the <a href="http://www.times-age.co.nz/news/snow-closes-hill-road/1005056/" target="_blank">hill road</a> connecting Wairarapa with Wellington. This had its own impact on people travelling to work and it was standing room only on the train for a few days. What I found most interesting was the reaction of <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/5457717/Latest-Wellington-snow-photos-August-17" target="_blank">Wellingtonians</a>, who showed a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5468555/Snow-video-seen-around-the-world" target="_blank">child-like fascination</a> for the snow fall, taking photos of each other and generally behaving like the whole of New Zealand had never had any before.

Back at New Bolton, Josh the goat has had a cold lonely week while we've been at work, prompting Denise to give him a handful of feed nuts when we get home. He soon associated our arrival with food and by the end of the week he was peeking out of his shelter watching for our return.

By this weekend, however, rain had washed away most of the snow and the weather has  returned to something resembling normal, which is a relief as it's certainly been the most persistent and prolonged period of foul weather we've had since we've been in New Zealand.
