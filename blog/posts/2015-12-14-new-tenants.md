The chook house has been up for <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2015/10/26/labour-weekend/" target="_blank">a few weeks</a> now and has passed extensive wind tunnel testing by way of not getting blown away in Featherston's frequent strong winds. After obtaining the other paraphernalia like feeder, water dispenser and a cordon to restrain the occupants from wandering off, we picked up four splendid pullets from a local supplier.

The blacks have been seen squabbling, presumably settling the pecking order[/caption]

The girls are only a few months old and not laying yet, the first eggs are some weeks off and doubtless will be followed by a celebratory omelette.

They seem to be settling in well and look happy. The ramp to the upstairs nesting box seems to have them somewhat baffled and they flap their way up rather than walk, settling themselves in when the sun is about to disappear behind the Rimutakas.
<p style="text-align:left;">For a limited time, <a href="http://newbolton.servebeer.com:81/rcam/public.php" target="_blank">ChookCam </a>will be operational so you can see what they get up to. Remember to check it during NZ daylight hours, currently GMT +13.</p>

Bird netting stops the local sparrows from helping themselves to the food.[/caption]

For those who are interested in this sort of thing, they are a mixed bag of Blue Leghorn cross and Silky cross. Denise is working on their names and there is definitely a pecking order being established with the two black Leghorns squaring up for position of top chook.
