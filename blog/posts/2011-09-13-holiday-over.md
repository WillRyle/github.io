Josh the goat's holiday with us came to an end on Sunday, as he returned to his home over the hill.

He always seemed lonely and bored, which I guess is understandable if you're tied up in a field on your own. The promised company of the neighbour's sheep never materialised as they've recently had lambs and Josh is known to be a bit lively in company.

His last week here saw him getting somewhat overly boisterous and I found him a bit of a handful when trying to move him on my own. The reason for this became clear when he returned home and headed straight for the paddock containingÂ his lady friends.
