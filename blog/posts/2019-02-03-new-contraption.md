Readers of this esteemed - if intermittent - blog have long been regaled with stories of ride-on lawn mowers, <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/12/07/mid-week-mower-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formation grass cutting</a> and the never-ending battle of man versus errant grass. Today saw the introduction of new equipment that not only brings the perfect lawn a step closer, but also supplies a much-needed ingredient in the other ongoing battle against weeds.

<!--more-->Grass clippings. The mulching mower is fine, but when the weather has kept the mowers away and the grass has overgrown its well-kept state, great clods of cut grass<span style="display:inline !important;float:none;background-color:transparent;color:#444444;font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0;"> loiter about the place in clumps and left in place kill the grass they sit on. </span><b></b><i></i><u></u><span style="text-decoration:line-through;"></span>

The traditional remedy is a grass-collecting attachment to the mower which bags up the cuttings and has an easy to empty mechanism to dump them into the compost heap. Unfortunately, attempts to find a grass catcher for our 20-year-old Cox mowers would likely end in failure, so it was time to brew up something homemade and in true Kiwi style we adjourned to the workshop.

The result looks very like a poor man's <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=robbie+the+robot&amp;t=hk&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Robbie the Robot</a>, but, astonishingly, it works. An adapter to turn the rectangular discharge chute to the hose connections was fabricated in fibreglass. A length of twin wall slotless drainage pipe was purchased from the local farm store and an old ton bag - of the sort bulk materials are delivered in - serves as the grass catcher. The discharge pipes run into holes in a board fixed to the front of our <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2018/04/08/new-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trusty garden trailer</a> around which the bag is stapled.

The fun bit is that the air flow from the cutters, through the adapter and up the pipes actually inflates the bag like those old-fashioned vacuum cleaners.

The practical bit is that the collected grass is a much-needed mulch that we can use around the vegetables to suppress weeds and retain moisture.
