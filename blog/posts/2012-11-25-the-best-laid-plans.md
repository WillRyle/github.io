<a title="A Shortage ofÂ Horsepower" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/a-shortage-of-horsepower/">Plan C</a> was our best hope for a spring planting to level and re-seed the section. It involved making contact with a local ploughing expert and have them turn over, level and re-seed the whole section.

As is the way with these things, they don't work out according to plan. Our chosen ploughman was unable to do the work because of other commitments, by which time finding an alternate would have been too late for a spring sowing. This has left us in a dilemma - now unable to re-seed until Autumn, how do we progress the rest of the work that was waiting on the re-seeding, like fencing and tree planting?

We've spent the last few weeks refining Plan D which is now taking shape. It involves spraying the boundaries so that fencing can progress, then tilling the area where the trees are to be planted. We will endeavour to level this with the ride-on towing some home-brewed levelling contraption, then re-seeding with grass and wild flowers before planting the orchard with fruit trees.

To reduce the amount of mowing, an area to the rear of the house - some 500 square metres - will be planted with a crop of sweet corn and peas, though quite what we're to do with the hoped for bountiful harvest has yet to be decided.

Having decided what was to be done, the next stage was to prioritise the work. First up is getting the corn in. Next will be spraying the boundary and ordering the timber for the fencing. With that under way - handy neighbour Neal in charge - a start can be made on the orchard area. In between there's a shed to be built to house the garden machinery and sundry junk still cluttering the pool room.

The first stages of work are in progress. The last two weekends and some evenings have been given over to tilling the area to be planted with corn. <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/tillingeasement-003.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-1381 alignleft" title="Sweet Corn Area" alt="" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/tillingeasement-003.jpg?w=300" height="225" width="300" /></a>This has been heavy going with a lot of the ground untouched by man and machine for a long time, which finally took its toll on the tiller which threw a tine. Fortunately we'd done enough work to to progress and I'd already got a new set of tines on order. The tilling process had left a lot of thatch and uprooted weeds scattered about. While raking this off by hand would have been hard work, we contrived a makeshift chain harrow by dragging a bundle of fencing wire behind the ride-on. This did a reasonable job of collecting the detritus together making it easier to handle.

In addition to the work on site, the tools and equipment necessary for the work are being assembled. Aside from ordering a new set of tines for the tiller, a gallon of Roundup and back pack sprayer have been acquired. Other attachments for the tiller are being investigated, with a furrow plough on order. If we can make this fit, it will save on much digging in future and open the way for other standard agricultural implements being pressed into service.

The vegetable garden still makes demands with fruit bushes needing protection from the birds. We've added beans of assorted varieties, more potatoes than we could possibly eat and have turned into a bit of a community effort with neighbours making donations of unused seed potatoes in desperate need of planting among other contributions.
