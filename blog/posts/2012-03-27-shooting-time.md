Another milestone at New Bolton - the first arrows were sent down the archery range today and some even made it on to the target. Taking some time off this week, I made up some arrows yesterday, fashioned a target stand this morning and improvised a target with two bales of pea straw from the local Big Orange Shed.

It's over four years now since I've done any archery, a sport which demands constant practice. With that in mind, I positioned the target a safe distance from neighbours and was still able to take 80 paces to the shooting line in the corner of the section. Being so rusty, I didn't expect great results.

It was a bit of a surprise to find the target within the first dozen arrows, but it wasn't surprising to find the almost forgotten aches and fatigue coming back after a few dozen more, the four years without practice making itself evident.
