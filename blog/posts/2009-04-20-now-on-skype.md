<div id="msgcns!6DC4413C2DF787C8!233" class="bvMsg"><p>I installed the communications software from <a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a> recently. It’s a lot like MSN Live Messenger in that it has chat, video and audio messaging. What won me over was the performance of the video call, which gave a better frame rate and picture quality. <p>It’s free to install and use for calling between Skype users, with subscription options to allow you to call ‘real’ telephones. There’s a Search facility too, so you’ll be able to find me if you install it.  </div>
