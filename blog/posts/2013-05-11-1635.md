Following on from last week's <a title="Tiller Time" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/04/29/tiller-time/">tilling</a>, the next stage is to try to level the ground. With no sign of levelling irons, I used the rake attachment that came with the tractor to remove the dead grass and make a start at levelling.

Sporting a new red top link and attachment pins, the rake made a commendable job.

With just the weekends available to us, we'd have trouble getting the whole section ready to allow an Autumn sowing.

We've yet to acquire levelling irons to do the next stage in the process and with none for sale locally, it may be necessary to hire them, assuming that such equipment is stocked.

As an alternative, it occurred to me that the carry tray that came with the tractor may be able to do a reasonable imitation of levelling irons. If the weather is favourable tomorrow, I may take the opportunity to experiment.

Update 13 May:

The experiment proved to be successful, in part at least. Using the carry tray as a rudimentary levelling iron made some improvement, but not to the extent that we're ready for rolling and seeding. The hunt for levelling irons and chain harrow continues.
