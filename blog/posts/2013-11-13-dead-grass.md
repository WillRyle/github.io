<p>Following the <a title="The Big Till" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/the-big-till/">Big Till</a> and the trouble caused by the clumps of dead grass and weed that littered the section, we pondered how to deal with it...</p><p><!--more--></p><p><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-001.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1750" alt="GroundWork 001" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-001.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-005.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1751" alt="GroundWork 005" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-005.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-013.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1752" alt="GroundWork 013" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-013.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-017.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1753" alt="GroundWork 017" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-017.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a>I tried raking it off with the tractor attachment. This was the method used during <a title="Raking It Off" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/1635/">our experiment</a> in the Autumn. On the larger area though, the drawback was the length of time it took to get to the dumping area and back and the spillage on the way.</p><p>To avoid this a change of tack was required. The dead grass was raked into heaps about the section. We then fitted the loading tray to the tractor and manually piled the grass onto it, drove to the dumping area at the rear of the house and scraped the stuff off again.</p><p>This was tedious work in the hot weather and took us most of the available time over the weekend. We had a brief respite when Gus the tractor failed to start owing to a flat battery, but made good use of the time by planting sweet corn.</p><p>By late Sunday afternoon we were done and the ground was looking better for it. What remains now is to chain harrow the lot and see if that leaves us ready to sow the seed.</p><p>Elsewhere on the section, Neale was finishing of the fencing on the boundaries adjoining neighbouring properties. This is a more agricultural affair using wire netting and steel posts driven into the ground.</p><p>To round the day off, Doug called by with a fully serviced and sharpened ride-on mower. All we need now is a lawn for it to cut.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-018.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1754" alt="GroundWork 018" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/groundwork-018.jpg?w=640" width="640" height="248" /></a></p>
