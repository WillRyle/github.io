New Zealanders often combine the Christmas holiday with their summer holidays, many of them spending some weeks at their beach homes, known locally as a 'bach' (say it like 'batch') We've seen cars, heavily loaded up, departing Wellington on Christmas eve and presumably headed for the bach (in one case with the Christmas tree strapped to the roof). Trips to the bach will likely continue at weekends throughout the summer. Now AMI insurance has encapsulated this behaviour as "New Zealandness" and built a range of TV adverts around it. I thought this one did a pretty good job: [youtube=http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpJP0APeNoE]
