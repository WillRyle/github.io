After the chores are done in the Saturday morning trip to Masterton, the afternoon is free for activities of choice.

Some work on the pool was followed by cranking up the newly acquired rotary hoe and turning over the ground at the rear of the house.

It made short work of a good sized area, which has previously been turned over by a tractor hauled rotary hoe and allowed us to sow some seed.

The next test of the big beast was turning over part of the section that hasn't been worked in a long time - the results of which will be posted later.
