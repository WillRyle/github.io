The long hiatus in blogging is another consequence of what's been a splendid summer in our part of the Southern Hemisphere. We're well in to Autumn and the days are getting shorter, but temperatures are still mild. Add to that Denise's second trip to the old country this year, a full and varied social calendar and a never diminishing list of jobs to do around New Bolton and I think I can be excused for not finding the time to write about what's been going on.

We had visitors in March, Denise's Aunt and Uncle, who spent a long weekend with us on their epic tour of New Zealand.

We were able to show them the sights of South Wairarapa - an area not generally on the tourist trail - and also introduce them to our friends in Featherston. Quite how we finished up tasting whisky at Jan &amp; Peter's until nearly midnight on the Friday is a bit of a mystery.

With Denise away at the end of March and for most of April, I was flying solo holding the fort and mixing domestic chores with gardening - preparing the ground and sowing oats for a Winter crop of green manure being one of them. Looking after the chooks was another, the surplus of eggs going to friends. I established a new chicken run on the crop area to the rear of the house, where it's hoped they will de-weed and fertilise this vegetable garden over Winter in time for a Spring planting. They're quite enjoying the extra space, but despite the abundance of forage, still follow us around in the expectation of a sweet corn or bacon rind treat. Egg production is good, though slowing down as Winter approaches and it's looking like the fourth chook has finally started laying, though we won't know for sure until we get four eggs in a day.

Away from home, a chance encounter on the train one Friday night resulted in Pete, Sue and myself meeting the owner of a <a href="https://bradencrosby.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Martinborough vineyard</a>. During our chat she mentioned that it was grape picking at their place that weekend and any help would be most welcome. The next day the three of us turned up much to the surprise and delight of the owners. I was concerned that we'd be more hindrance than help, but we acquitted ourselves admirably and made a good contribution, seeing the day's work done in shorter order than would otherwise have been the case and being rewarded with a fine lunch.

Another notable event in Featherston recently has been the <a href="http://www.aratoi.org.nz/exhibition/2016/03/farewell-zealandia-forgotten-kiwi-songs-ww1" target="_blank">Farewell Zealandia</a> exhibition at the town's ANZAC hall. This is a commemoration of songs from NZ's involvement in the First World War. I volunteered to help out by manning the exhibition on two occasions.

With such a workload I'd be glad of a bit of Winter weather to give me a break, but what we do get is strong winds pulling the bird netting off the chicken run adding to the list of jobs and diverting me from the construction of a log store. In the pipeline, our much awaited garage build gets a little closer. After a lengthy process of exploring our options, we've settled on a design and builder and hope to sign contracts soon. The actual build is still some weeks away, but will doubtless give us ample blogging material.
