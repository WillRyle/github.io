<p>It's Winter and it rains in Winter, that much we understand, but this has to be the most prolonged wet period we've had in our short time here. Even our well-drained paddock is squelchy underfoot. It doesn't rain constantly - we get a sunny day occasionally, sometimes on a weekend too - the ground dries a little then the rain comes again.</p><p><!--more--></p><p><a href="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/winter-005.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1965 size-medium" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/winter-005.jpg?w=300" alt="Winter 005" width="300" height="225" /></a>With it too wet to cut the grass, the ride-on mower hasn't seen action for weeks now. The grass is still growing slowly, but battered by the rain into uneven clumps. It's going to take a lot of work to get the lawn in to shape when the rains finally give us the chance.</p><p><a href="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/winter-002.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1966 size-medium" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/winter-002.jpg?w=300" alt="Winter 002" width="300" height="225" /></a>In the vegetable plot the lupins grow slowly and the garlic we planted on the shortest day has emerged.</p><p>The lupins need to be dug in before they flower in order to do their best as green manure, but if that time arrives before the ground is dry we'll finish up with a mud bath if we put the tiller to work on it.</p><p><a href="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/winter-017.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1967 size-medium" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/winter-017.jpg?w=300" alt="Winter 017" width="300" height="225" /></a>Our new neighbours have carried on the previous owner's policy of having sheep. These seem more inquisitive than the last lot and more vocal too. They don't seem to mind the cold Southerly blowing through at the moment, even the new lambs are gambolling around in finest Spring lamb tradition. The ram - seen in the photo with the horns and coloured coat - is, we're told, less belligerent than the previous ram. I'll not put that to the test just yet, just put another log on the fire as we wait for Spring to turn up.</p><p>Â </p>
