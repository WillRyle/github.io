We took a break from jobs about the garden this weekend and had a splendid time of it with friends.

It started with Friday drinks, we rolled off the train from Wellington and on to the bus to Martinborough. Eight of us in total, we made the first stop in this 'wine village' at, oddly, a brewery. Here we sampled the locally made beers then moved to wine, for which this splendid little Wairarapa town is famous. Then followed a meal at one of the many boutique restaurants before the taxi back to Featherston.

Saturday saw us at the Wairarapa Agricultural and Pastoral show. We've been to the Summer Masterton one several times, but always managed to miss this Spring event. Like all these shows in New Zealand, it was a relaxed and casual affair. The usual attractions were present in what was a smaller event than the Masterton show - cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry were all shown and judged and awards given. Horses were show jumped and competitions held for sheep shearing - it was all a typically Kiwi affair.

One thing on the programme that caught my eye was the sheep racing - this was something we had to see.

This odd event included jockeys - stuffed and tied to the sheep's back - and an incentive for the sheep - food at the end of the course, for which they're prepared to run at some speed.

After the A&amp;P show we took ourselves to a charity concert in Featherston. It's an annual event now in its third year, where the local Country &amp; Western band do a performance and donate the proceeds to a good cause. Although this type of music is not my favourite genre, we had a great time. The show started with some young acts - one performer being just 10 years old - and continued with more experienced talent. A rendition of Duelling Banjos was particularly popular, even if one of the banjos was actually a guitar.

Needless to say, after two late nights Sunday was a bit sluggish. We managed some useful work nonetheless with Denise sowing some salad crops in pots. Normal service will doubtless be resumed next weekend.
