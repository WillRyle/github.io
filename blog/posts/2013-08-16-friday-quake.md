With the week drawing to a close and Friday after work drinks to look forward to, the office today was busy, but in that winding-down-for-the-weekend way, until a sudden swaying sensation made itself felt...

People looked at each other in that 'did you feel that' sort of way. A certain apprehension was in the air when the swaying was followed by a more vigorous shaking that had everyone taking cover under desks. It wasn't for long as the violence soon subsided, but the swaying continued for some time. Shortly after the order came to evacuate the building and we made our way outside following the path we'd taken in a routine fire drill only two days before.

Within a few minutes the first of many fire engine sirens were heard as we milled about on the pavement that was our evacuation point. Not long after we were told to call it a day and I managed to rendezvous with Denise. The trains were not running so we made our way by buses to Upper Hutt where neighbour Pete - who had fortuitously been working from home - was waiting for us, having driven the 30km over the hill from Featherston.

Back at New Bolton, there was no damage, so we adjourned to The Royal to toast our good fortune and thank Pete for his timely intervention.
