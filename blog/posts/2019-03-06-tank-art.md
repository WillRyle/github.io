Our water tank does a good job of collecting rainwater for use in the garden. It sits there without complaining, rain or shine, all big and blue. If there's any criticism to be made, it's that it's a bit boring. Measuring 3m high and 3.5m wide, it was just a plain circular wall almost begging for attention. Finally, our newly retired neighbour Pete answered the call.

<!--more-->Tank art is a <a href="https://tankart.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thing</a>, apparently and has a number of solutions. Pete eschewed such convention and rummaged through his collection of paint pots and got to work.

Being a water tank, the theme had to be the sea and we came up with a whole load of daft ideas to incorporate - the Yellow Submarine with the pipe as the periscope is hard to miss, but look for mermaids, a diver, treasure chest, sunken wreck and assorted sea creatures.
