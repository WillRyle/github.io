The imminent arrival of guests from England spurred us into action inside the house recently as we tackled the organised chaos of the pool room.

Emptying the room was a feat in itself - space was found in the shed for the bikes, all the boxes were emptied and their contents found their way to shelves, cupboards and drawers and we soon had an empty room.

The next task was preparing the floor for painting and acid etching it to help the paint stick. We chose a Sandstone coloured concrete paint into which we tipped a fine grit. When applied, this gives a slightly coarse feel to the floor which is intended to reduce the chance of slipping when wet - having nearly come a cropper several times on the wet floor, we thought this a good precaution.

Handy neighbour Pete took it upon himself to construct and paint a changing screen. Resplendent in a beach scene mural it's not only superbly functional but contributes to the seaside theme we'd decided on for the room.

Another step was assembling and positioning the gym equipment we've accumulated. The multi-gym and rowing machine have been in storage waiting for a space to be allocated to them and now finally their time had come.

Our visitors duly arrived and wandering around Martinborough Fair on their first weekend here they kindly bought us a painting depicting brightly coloured beach huts - a perfect fit for a large empty space on the pool room wall.

The next, and hopefully final, task is to panel in the sides of the pool. This will be in marine ply to match the coping, a job I'm hoping to tackle before another two years have elapsed.
