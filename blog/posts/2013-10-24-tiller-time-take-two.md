Last time we had the tiller out to do a substantial piece of work was in the <a title="Tiller Time" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/04/29/tiller-time/">Autumn</a>, when the orchard area was turned over in preparation for seeding. We levelled the ground and were close to the finish when the weather turned and was far too wet to seed.

Now, a year after we attempted to get a team of <a title="Spring Preparations" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/09/02/spring-preparations/">Clydesdales</a> to plough, level and seed the garden, we're on the cusp of doing the job ourselves.

Subsequent <a title="The Best Laid Plans" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/the-best-laid-plans/">disappointments</a> led to us acquiring our own <a title="Boys Toys Part Three" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/boys-toys-part-three/">little grey Fergie</a> and last Autumn's effort was a trial run and learning exercise. Although we didn't get to complete the seeding, lessons were learnt and we've been assembling the necessary equipment and making preparations in anticipation of starting ground work this weekend, which is a three-day affair with Monday off for Labour Day.

This was especially difficult because of the intermittent heavy rain, but we finally managed it. The mowing was a pre-cursor to spraying the grass with Roundup to kill it off and last Sunday saw us blessed with sunny weather and light to zero wind - ideal spraying conditions.

On the equipment side, we took delivery this week of a spiked chain harrow. This turned out to be a weighty piece of kit coming in at over 100kg. Its 'spikes' are more like little knives and it certainly looks capable.

To drag the harrow around a drawbar was required for Gus, our venerable Fergie, which also arrived this week and is reassuringly heavy as well.

The final piece of kit required are levelling irons and these have been booked with the hire shop for collection on Saturday.

So, with the grass showing signs of dying off, all the equipment arranged and fuel for the tiller obtained, we're hoping for favourable weather this weekend to begin the till-a-thon on Saturday.
