The rain that blighted the build on Tuesday and Wednesday cleared today, allowing work to continue. We came home - early for a change, with daylight left to take decent photos - to see more of the roof installed.

The shuttering to the right of the house (above left) is the base of the pool equipment shed. This will be built to match the house, with weather board walls and ColorSteel roof. This will also serve as the garden shed until such time as the garage and outbuildings project starts.
