This has been a long weekend with Monday off for a public holiday - Labour day. This is the first break of the new season, much like Easter is in the old country.

Its origins hark back to colonial times when a newly arrived carpenter by the name of Samuel Parnell refused to work more than eight hours a day on a contract to build a new store. With skilled labour in short supply and Parnell organising other tradesmen, the eight-hour working day was established. Fifty years later in October 1890, the eight-hour day was celebrated and has continued to be since, obtaining public holiday status in 1900. Parnell died just weeks after addressing the 1890 demonstration. His funeral was given public status and his coffin carried to Wellington cemetery by relays of working men.

This is all good news of course, we get a long weekend at a time of year when the garden needs plenty of attention and we've been busy for a few weekends now preparing the ground - quite literally - for a major planting up session. After three days hard work digging, tilling, mowing, planting and late finishes, 'labour' weekend has taken on a whole new meaning and it has nothing to do with a meagre eight hours a day work.

The end result is looking rather tidy. Needless to say we didn't get as much done as we'd hoped and it's hard to decide if we've been over-ambitious or, despite the aches, not as productive as we should have been.

We've planted more potatoes than I care to count and there's still some left to go in the ground.

We decided to take it easy on Monday and Denise set to creating a herb garden, while I assembled the new chook house that arrived the other week. Although we'd chosen a white coop, it still got the de-facto <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2015/01/08/a-certain-theme/" target="_blank">New Bolton style</a> applied and looks a lot better for it. The chooks have yet to be arranged, but the accommodation is ready for four lucky birds.

We're left with a lot of space to fill with more planting, but at least the hardest of the work is done and we've a good idea of what is to go where.
