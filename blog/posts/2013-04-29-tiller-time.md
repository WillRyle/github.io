Our plans to plough, level and re-seed the section were outlined <a title="Boys Toys PartÂ Three" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/boys-toys-part-three/">earlier</a> and formulated after the acquisition of Gus, the venerable Fergie. Yesterday the first stage was implemented with the tilling of the area soon to become an orchard.

Equipped with new tines, the tiller made short work of about a quarter of the area to be re-seeded taking less than four hours (including tea breaks, lunch and chatting to the neighbours).

While the tiller is self-driven and steerable, it's a heavy lump and keeping it on track takes some work. It did uncover some tree roots which had to be dug out. Despite the mechanisation, this is still a manual task and I certainly knew it by the time the job was done.

The next stage is where I get to play with the tractor, using a tine grubber to rake through the tilled soil prior to levelling and rolling. When we've been through the process up to seeding, we'll be in a position to judge if there's time to do the rest of the section this Autumn, or leave it until Spring. With only weekends available to us, we're hoping for favourable weather.
