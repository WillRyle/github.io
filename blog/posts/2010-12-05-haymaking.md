The grass is cut and dried. The bales are made. Our acre and a half yielded eleven of these large bales, but the mower man did leave a lot uncut.

There are trees around the boundary and a small strip is fenced off. We'd warned him about the possibility of discovering hidden obstacles in the long grass, so he was doubtless wary of breaking his mower. That notwithstanding, he managed to discover another pile of tyres, giving us a total of 24 - a good van load - to take to the tip.

Wednesday is Site Visit day, where we meet the builders on site to discuss where the power/water/phone is to be brought on site, the route of the driveway and the location and orientation of the house itself. This is a first for us, we've never had to decide where a house is to go, nor the direction it is to face.

The builder wants to get the foundation slab down before Christmas, when a lot of Kiwis take their summer holidays and don't return to work until the end of January. In the meantime, we're enjoying some fine weather after a long winter, so after all the tribulations that have got us to where we are now, there's a summer of building to look forward to.
