Our Southern Hemisphere summer continues its lacklustre performance with rain, sun and   wind mixed in random order, reminiscent of my memories of an English summer. On the positive side, it is still reasonably warm and the rain means that grass and plants grow at a rate that is almost perceptible to the human eye.

The downside is that such vigorous growth means more work keeping things under control. The ride-on mower has been much used, and getting bored with riding round in ever-decreasing rectangles, I decided to drive round in ever-increasing circles.

The finished result looked somewhat like a mysterious crop circle, and spawned a thought or two about what other patterns could be cut in future. Dismissing a <a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/mandelbrot.html" target="_blank">Mandelbrot set</a> as too difficult, maybe readers could make suggestions in the comments...
