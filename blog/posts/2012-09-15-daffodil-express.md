Living in the Antipodes and having moved from the Northern Hemisphere means that one is not only converting  currency and timezones, but also the seasons. Denise's birthday on the 8th September has, in the North, always been in that 'Indian Summer' phase of the weather cycle, Summer's last Hurrah! before the Autumn chills begin. Here in New Zealand it is in early Spring - the time of daffodils and lengthening days, so how is the same day of the year different down South?

After a particularly wet winter, I'd like to report that a Kiwi Spring is much like an English late Summer, but this time I can't. It had been raining all week and windy with it. On Saturday we watched near horizontal rain slam into the windows  and dashed, between downpours, to The Royal for Denise's birthday dinner.

The nearby town of Carterton has an annual <a href="http://www.wairarapanz.com/article/carterton-daffodil-carnival-returns-with-trains-and-gardens-too" target="_blank">Spring Fair</a> that celebrates the Daffodil, and Sunday was the nominated day. As a day out picking daffodils has limited appeal, the event has grown into a craft fair and special trains are laid on from the capital to allow Wellingtonians to enjoy the event. 'Special trains' in this context means a good old-fashioned steam locomotive - the Daffodil Express is real and probably exclusive to New Zealand.

This behemoth from the Steam Age hauled 10 carriages and a baggage car from Wellington, pausing only to be dragged through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimutaka_Tunnel" target="_blank">Rimutaka Rail Tunnel </a>by a diesel loco, as the tunnel is too long to allow smokers through.

As if that wasn't enough for Kiwi train spotters, also putting in an appearance was the restored railcar <a title="Railcar" href="http://www.railcars.co.nz/rm31.htm" target="_blank">Rm31 Tokomaru</a>.

You may be wondering where the daffodils are amongst all the hardware. Carrington House for starters, that's where. This is a Wairarapa approximation to a stately home, with gardens open to the public by appointment and on Daffodil Carnival day. Built by an ex-pat Mancunian - the Reverend William Booth - in 1874, it's positively ancient by local standards.

The rains had left the ground soft underfoot and we took care to avoid getting muddy shoes.

How daffodils - an ordinary and rather unremarkable flower in the North - became the object of such attention in the Wairarapa is left for the reader to ponder; Denise and I were headed to Martinborough for her second Birthday Dinner - because when your birthday is on a Saturday, it's now a weekend long affair, apparently.
