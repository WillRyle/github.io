After a long period under construction, a new hen house for our flock has finally been put into use. We have smart phones, smart TVs and now a smart chook house.

<!--more-->

The old coop was only big enough for four hens and was lacking in the robustness required for our windy conditions - being blown over on two occasions and requiring a number of running repairs to keep it weather tight. With plans to expand our flock to eight birds, something bigger was needed, but by the time the thing was finished we were down to just one of the original four chooks, two having succumbed to prolonged illnesses and a third to some predator, having insisted on roosting in a tree rather than the hen house.

As luck would have it, two of our neighbours were renewing their flocks and had seven birds - still laying - that we could have. We took them if only to give our sole survivor some company and spare the seven from being culled.

The new coop is a far more solid affair than the previous one, being made largely of 35mm plywood sourced from the Menz Shed. This chook palace boasts two nesting and roosting areas either side of an automatically opening and closing door - the 'smart' in 'smart chook house' starts here.

This is not some store-bought auto opener purchased at great expense, but as regular readers know from the <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/category/irrigator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autonomous irrigator</a> project, in this age of small computers anything is possible.

The door opener is a repurposed mechanism from an old flat-bed document scanner, whose travel down a sheet of A4 paper was ample to move the door wide enough for a chook to enter. The open and close actions are triggered by a daylight sensor whereby a light level reading taken every five minutes determines if it is getting lighter or darker. If the light level then lies beyond configurable parameters, the door is either closed or opened. The computation is taken care of by a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> single board computer, powered by a 12 volt battery, which in turn is charged by a 20 watt solar panel fixed to the hen house roof.

Grills from a PC case cover the air vents of the hen house, letting air in but keeping the sparrows out.

That this project took so long is an indicator of learning curves that had to be climbed and new skills to be acquired - namely getting to grips with stepper motor control to finely tune the door's position and travel; and learning how to solder tiny electronic components onto a circuit board.

Other features of the smart hen house include a camera to keep an eye on what they are up to and a remotely switchable light to help with after dark inspections.

For this I borrowed a memory from a previous life moving helicopters with skids while on the ground. The ground handling wheels fitted to the Gazelle pictured are not a permanent fixture but installed by slotting the wheel into a receptacle on the skid then levering about an eccentric cam to lift the skid off the ground. With wheels on both skids, pulling down on the tailboom makes the aircraft wheel-borne and it can then be pushed into the hangar.

For the chook house application, two levers were fabricated that can be fixed to the chassis using tractor pins. Pushing down on the levers lifts one end of the chook house and allows a custom made trolley to be put underneath. Repeating the process at the other end and fitting a steerable trolley leaves the chook house entirely on wheels allowing it to be pushed into position. When in place, the procedure is reversed to sit the house on the ground. Its solid and heavy construction hasn't moved even in strong winds.

Our new chooks have taken to their accommodation very well and now manage to find their way to bed before the door closes at dusk. Our surviving chook - once top hen - is finding its place in the pecking order with the new arrivals and has been seen beating a hasty retreat when pursued by greater numbers. Best of all though is that egg production is up and improving as the condition of the birds improves.
