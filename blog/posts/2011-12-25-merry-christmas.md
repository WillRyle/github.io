It's Christmas morn in New Zealand, one of the first places in the World to welcome in the day and a truly splendid one it is too.

The view from New Bolton is clear, calm and quiet with blue skies, no wind and near total silence. A perfect Wairarapa summer's day.

Last year, by way of Christmas greetings I <a title="Christmas Cheer" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/christmas-cheer/">posted a video</a> of a flash mob's rendition of Handel's Hallelujah Chorus. This year I came across another performance of the same music, but with a slightly different presentation.

Merry Christmas everybody.
