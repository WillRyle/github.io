En-route to the Mother Country, we're kicking our heels at Sydney Airport waiting for the connecting flight to Abu Dhabi and then Manchester.

As airports go, Sydney's is spectacularly unimpressive, with bland architecture and a chaos of duty-free shops mixed up with the gate lounges. The free wi-fi which allows me to post this from the transit lounge is possibly its main redeeming feature.

In contrast, the Airbus A380 which just taxied past the window can't fail to impress, if only for its size.

This Singapore Airlines example is the first I've seen close up. They're too big for Wellington's tiny airport and as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380" target="_blank">Wiki page</a> explains, many larger airports have had to make alterations to accommodate the World's largest airliner.
