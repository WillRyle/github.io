Featherston is a township of less than 3,000 people. It's not without its problems, but crime isn't a major one. Such trouble as there is comes from the delinquency of bored youth.

The <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/8171202/Man-dies-after-Featherston-assault" target="_blank">news </a>last weekend that a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/8194803/Hundreds-gather-for-Jones-funeral" target="_blank">Featherston man</a> had died from injuries suffered while his house was burgled should have been a shock to the system, but experienced observers will know that there is no cure for, and no escape from, this particular human condition.

The 'suspects' have been arrested within a week, the last giving himself up to Police, presumably after realising there was nowhere to run. The first <a href="http://www.times-age.co.nz/news/five-court-after-brutal-death/1722476/" target="_blank">court hearings</a> have taken place and doubtless the wheels of justice will turn slowly to reach the inevitable conclusion. What the sentences will be is a detail, New Zealand doesn't have the death penalty, the usual mitigating circumstances will be pleaded and all that will vary is the length of the 'life' imprisonment.

At this point my thoughts will turn medieval and I'll find myself sharpening the axe.
