We've long planned a deck around the house - it's a Kiwi thing. The trouble is, our house sits close to the ground on a concrete foundation, rather than the wooden piles that elevate many NZ houses and so lend themselves to a wooden deck. With little room for a timber structure, friendly neighbour Trevor - who is tasked with the work - suggested a concrete deck, known to the rest of the English-speaking world as a patio.

After some discussion about colour and finish options, I was convinced, though I was aided in my deliberations by the cost factor - the concrete solution totalling about half that of the timber one.

The work was scheduled to start early this week, but the Winter wet weather put paid to such ambitions and it was Friday afternoon before Trevor was able to drive his mini-digger across the road to New Bolton to prepare the ground by scraping away the vegetation.

Today, with the rain holding off, Trevor with brother Gavin and son Mark continued their work setting out and levelling off with hardcore.

The finished level will be 100mm below floor level with a slope away from the house to allow the rain to run off. With the patio extending about 3 metres from the house, along its full length and wrapping around the living room, the total area is about 100 square metres.

By the time the day's work was done, the outlook had improved considerably. Not only was the Sun out, the half-finished patio was already making a positive impression. The finished article will have coloured concrete and a tile pattern cut in. A semi-gloss sealer will prevent staining. With luck a concrete mixer will be on site before next Saturday.
