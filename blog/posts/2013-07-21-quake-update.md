Whilst the effect of this afternoon's quake were minor here in Wairarapa, it seems Wellington has <a href="http://www.3news.co.nz/More-quakes-shake-North-Island/tabid/423/articleID/305731/Default.aspx" target="_blank">suffered some damage</a>. The day job has called with instructions to work from home, which is probably just as well given the trains are likely to be disrupted or replaced by buses. After our <a title="A BleakÂ Mid-Winter" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/a-bleak-mid-winter/" target="_blank">experience</a> following the recent storm, a lengthy bus journey is something best avoided.

The T.V news is reporting one injury, so we're not looking at anything like the scale of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake" target="_blank">Christchurch</a>, but an event of a big enough size to cause disruption to the capital, a bit like a storm really.
