Saturday last saw the pool plumbing marathon come to an end with the hydrotherapy jets finally commissioned.

This was not without incident as, having not seated two of the jet seals properly (awkward suckers that they are), water squirted from the air tubes as soon as the pump was started. It took several attempts to fix the problem, by which time we'd given the floor drain a thorough testing.

That the jets have taken so long to complete has many causes, not least idleness on my part as we enjoy our swimming and forsake the chores.

To celebrate the occasion on Saturday night, we enjoyed a leisurely massage while sipping fizzy wine and watching <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/science/6565684/Venus-and-Jupiter-dance-in-the-night-sky" target="_blank">Venus and Jupiter's special show </a> through the window as the sun set.

This is not the end of the job though. We still have a good amount of work to complete the pool room - clearing the junk out, painting the floor, panelling in the sides of the pool, adding changing facilities and the other detail touches that will make all the difference.
