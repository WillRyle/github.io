It's been a hot weekend in the Wairarapa with temperatures in the 30-32C range, too hot for manual labour on the section. We sweltered on Saturday at the <a href="http://www.martinboroughfair.org.nz/" target="_blank">Martinborough Fair</a> in the morning and later in the afternoon at home with the doors and windows open. When the mosquitoes started coming inside and biting us after dark, we shut up and resorted to the air conditioning.

Sunday was hot again, but this time we decided, in the best of British tradition, to retreat to the coast and headed off to Lake Ferry - air conditioning on full - in our trusty van. True enough, the sea breeze made for a more amenable climate and we lunched at North Island's most southerly hotel &amp; bar, the <a href="http://www.lakeferryhotel.co.nz/" target="_blank">Lake Ferry Hotel</a>. I've written before about <a title="Lake Ferry" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/lake-ferry/">Lake Ferry</a>, which is not only a splendid place in itself, but allows visitors to drive through the magnificent Wairarapa countryside to get there.

Throughout the weekend we'd heard news reports of inclement weather being endured by the Harbour Capital, Wellington, just a few miles to the West over the Rimutakas, where temperatures of barely 20C and drizzle had persisted.

I knew full well the cause of this divide between East and West and at Lake Ferry we could see the evidence writ large before us.

The westerly winds that had brought foul weather to the capital met with the impressive bulk of the Rimutaka range, which did an admirable job of blocking the drizzle-laden clouds from blighting our weekend. Throughout our lunch in the sunshine, I watched as the clouds tumbled down the hills only to be burnt off by the heat.

Later we paddled along the shoreline, the warmth of Lake Onoke giving way to the more chill waters of Palliser Bay, itself part of the temperamental Cooke Strait.

Having enjoyed a few beers, I relinquished driving duties to Denise who took the wheel and steered a course for home while I gawped at the scenery, by now thoroughly chilled.
