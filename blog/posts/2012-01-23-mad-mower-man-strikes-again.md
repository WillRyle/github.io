Monday is a public holiday in the Wellington region so we're enjoying a long weekend. The weather not being particularly summer-like, the morning was spent in the pool followed by a leisurely breakfast. By mid afternoon things had improved and the outdoor beckoned. With a choice of garden machinery to play with, the only question was which one to use.

Denise opted for the line trimmer and duly equipped, went to do battle with the long grass where the tree stumps used to be. I elected to join the fray with the ride-on, the plan being to use the line trimmer where what was lurking in the grass was unknown, and the ride-on to cut back the rest. My last <a title="A Mad Mower Moment" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/01/15/a-mad-mower-moment/">mad mower moment</a> about a year ago was restricted to the puny horsepower of our regular rotary mower. This time I had <a title="Boy’s Toys" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/12/25/boys-toys/">12.5hp</a> with which to do damage.

Our two-pronged approach soon yielded results and within a couple of hours we were done. The finished result makes the whole section appear bigger, but the aim of the exercise was to ready the ground for the <a title="Boys Toys – The Sequel" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/01/22/boys-toys-the-sequel/">tiller</a>.

Unfortunately, we're back at work tomorrow, so getting to grips with the tiller will be a job for another day.
