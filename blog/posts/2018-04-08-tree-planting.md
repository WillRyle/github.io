Finally - after many delays, changes of plan and adverse weather - we finally made a significant step in planting up the long-awaited orchard.

<!--more-->In a busy Sunday that saw some tractor action harrowing the crop area at the rear - following up on <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2018/04/01/harvest-time-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last weekend's efforts</a> -Â  we moved to the orchard. We'd already marked out where the trees were to go and first in were six olive trees in a single row. This will form one side of an avenue of olives heading diagonally across the section. Another six trees are yet to be purchased and planted on the other side and when grown will allow archery practice to take place sheltered by trees.

Second to go in was one of two peach trees donated by a friend. This was given plenty of room in one of the bays formed by the olive trees and blueberry hedge. We ran out of time to get the second one in, but the delay will give us time to consider where to put it.

Plans are in hand to take advantage of this time of year when the hot and dry weather is over, but there's still enough light for good growth before Winter proper.
