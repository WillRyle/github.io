We woke up this morning to a bank of low mist where the Rimutaka range usually is. So low and dense was it that the hills were completely obscured.

With the sun coming up I knew the mist would soon burn off. By the time I'd got the camera, the vague outline of the closest hills could just about be seen.

Within five minutes, the sun had done its work and stayed with us for another splendid Wairarapa day.
