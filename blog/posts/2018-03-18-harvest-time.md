It's been an odd Summer, mostly hot and dry interspersed with very wet and windy. The cause has been a number of tropical cyclones having their last gasp over New Zealand and giving some challenging conditions in the garden.

<!--more--><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2472" src="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/wp_20180119_17_47_34_pro.jpg?w=300" alt="Summer 2018" width="300" height="169" />We started off so well - planting early potatoes, main crop potatoes, sweet corn, tomatoes, pumpkins, sunflower and others - in the hope that they would get well established before the big hot and dry arrived. It arrived with a vengeance, a wet spring giving way almost overnight to temperatures in the high 20-low 30 Celsius range.

The first sign of things going awry was when the sweet corn popped up and looked suspiciously like peas. This wouldn't ordinarily be a problem, we'd just have lots of peas and no sweet corn, except that there's a <a href="https://mpi.govt.nz/news-and-resources/media-releases/pea-growers-work-with-mpi-to-rid-wairarapa-of-weevil-pest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wairarapa-wide ban</a> on growing peas because of a pest known as a pea weevil. Closer inspection of our seed supply revealed that we'd put surplus pea seed into an empty sweet corn seed tin and had indeed sown row after row of peas thinking they were sweet corn. We dutifully pulled up all the pea seedlings and replanted with a mix of seed (definitely sweet corn this time) and young plants, hoping to recover from the mishap.

The new plants duly appeared and were doing well when the first strong winds came along and flattened a good number. Previous experience with this has shown that it's not necessarily terminal for the plant and they often recover. We took our <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2018/02/07/summer-holiday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holiday</a> and were glad to hear that it had rained in our absence, so the garden wasn't completely parched.

As Summer progressed and with the sweet corn and sunflower doing well, another period of strong winds caused more damage, setting a pattern of growth followed by wind damage which has left the sweet corn in particular looking pretty dire and any produce will likely finish up as chook food.

Elsewhere in the garden there was better news. The early crop potatoes did well and were served up for Christmas and New Year dinner. We have more tomatoes than we can process and enough in the freezer to keep us going for a while. The pumpkins also fared well and we have a good number of a useable size. The only other error on our part was the sunflower. We had seed of various types of sunflower, including one that was capable of reaching 6 foot in height. Unfortunately, anything over about 3 feet is too tall for ALIS the irrigator's spray boom, which had to be removed and replaced with a more makeshift arrangement with hose pipe and nozzles.

One positive thing about the cyclones and the heavy rain that they brought, is that the water tank was replenished. We were down to about 74% (shown on a LCD receiver from the tank level Wi-Fi transmitter) when the first downpour arrived during Sunday morning coffee with the gang, and every increase in the tank level was greeted with a cheer. By day's end we were up to 100% and despite the attentions of ALIS and other hose pipes in use, we finish the Summer with the tank full.

The wind has always presented challenges for us and we thought that the new garage would have further sheltered the crop area from the prevailing North Westerlies. The damaging winds this Summer were Southerly or - unusually - North Easterly and so tore up the length of the crop area from both ends. Next season we will try installing a series of low-level hurdle wind breaks to try to protect taller crops.
