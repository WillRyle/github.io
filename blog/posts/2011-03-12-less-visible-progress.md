After the big spectacular frame erecting, this week has been more modest in its visual appeal, with less visible detail work being done, mostly on the roof structure.

We've seen more timber added to the roof, the fixing of the roof trusses to the wall plate, steel bracing nailed in place and the upright supports for the porch concreted in position. All followed by the addition of fascia boards to gables and eaves.

Next week will likely see the roof go on, followed by the addition of building paper, a water proof membrane fixed to the outside of the framework.

Elsewhere on the section we busied ourselves with the ongoing saga of the tree stumps, removing the growth and stripping the bark from the last one on the street frontage making the total around <del>45</del> 55.

Next is the removal of all their suckers, which are busy trying to grow from when we had them cut back in December. For the most part these have grown from discarded branches - a feature of Poplars, apparently - and so should be relatively easy to extract with my newly acquired mattock. Those that aren't will be pruned at ground level so any growth can be mowed off.
