So, we left Wellington at 5:00pm on Sunday afternoon, flew for about 14 hours and arrived in Vancouver at 4:00pm on Sunday, an hour before we departed. How does that work?, I hear you ask - the International Date Line I reply, the cause of much confusion to the unwary traveller.

This has given us the longest day ever - a forty hour Sunday, though the destination is worth the journey. Too early for bed, we wandered down Vancouver's Gas Town district and found a splendid bar where we sampled some good local beers and had a bite to eat.
