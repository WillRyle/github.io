The town has been fair buzzing this weekend as it hosted the first Booktown. A team of <a href="http://www.booktown.org.nz/#!about/c476" target="_blank">dedicated enthusiasts</a> have worked over the last few months to secure Featherston as New Zealand's <a href="http://www.booktown.org.nz/" target="_blank">'Booktown'</a>. Book towns have been around since the first was established in Haye on Wye in Wales in 1961. They are typically small country towns within easy reach of a major city that set up events around books - selling them, writing, reading, illustrating, printing, making and publishing them.

Establishing Featherston as a book town is a major triumph for the organisers and the least Denise and I could do was volunteer to help out. We donned the booktown aprons and set up tables for vendors to sell their wares and wandered about the town directing people to the many book-related events that were taking place.

Despite less than favourable weather, feedback has been all positive. Book sellers reported good sales and a willingness to come back next year with their colleagues. Visitors were buying books up until closing time. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/featherstonbooktown?fref=nf" target="_blank">facebook site</a> will give readers a taste of what's been going on this weekend, meanwhile a contented glow surrounds the town untouched by the rain and strong winds - something good happened in Featherston this weekend and it happened because of Featherstonians.
