Things have been progressing suspiciously well in the vineyard. First, the posts were installed in good time, then the vines arrived on schedule and today, during a glorious Spring day, all 54 vines were planted in short order.

Our Saturday morning coffee with friends morphed seamlessly into a vine planting lesson hosted by our resident expert Neale. He gave us both, plus neighbours Pete and Sue, clear instructions on how to plant and get the best results. Vines, it seems, don't like overly fertile soil and have a minimal demand for water. They don't have a tap root, instead boast two varieties - one sort goes deep and the other shallow and widespread.

Planting involved adding a little blood and bone fertiliser to the hole and spreading the roots outwards to avoid them spiralling around in a pot-bound fashion. We have two Pinot Noir clones, the <a href="http://www.riversun.co.nz/grapevines/varieties-and-clones/#vclone-335" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famous-in-NZ Abel</a> and another with the bland label '<a href="http://www.riversun.co.nz/grapevines/varieties-and-clones/#vclone-345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCD5</a>'. The more vigorous UCD5 was planted upwind, being better able to cope with our windy conditions and offer shelter to Abel.

Planting is just the beginning of course, Neale has already briefed us of the upcoming battles against frost, birds, pests, too much rain, not enough rain, but finally, after years as an idea and more years in the planning, our own micro vineyard is a reality. I love it when a plan comes together.
