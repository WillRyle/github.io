There was a definite culture shock during our first days in Vancouver. Arriving from small town New Zealand to a city of 2 million people gave us quite a start - noise, traffic, congestion, people, litter and beggars in such concentrated proliferation required some acclimatization. Vancouver's social problems probably aren't any worse than many other cities, but when you consider that its population is nearly half of the whole of NZ, the scale of the hit on our senses can be appreciated.

The other first impression was how similar the city is to those we've seen in the USA. This is used to good effect by the burgeoning Vancouver film industry, where it is a lot cheaper to make a movie than Hollywood and most cinema goers wouldn't notice the difference.

So, a lot like the US, but I noticed the proper British spelling on all the signage. There's also a curious hybrid measurement system in use - the road distances are all metric, but beer is served in fluid ounces and produce sold by the pound, except when they're sold in metric measures. Canadians still drive on the wrong side of the road though, so don't score full marks for carrying the traditions of the Mother country.

Our hotel is near Vancouver's old Gastown area, home to the much photographed Steam Clock and an abundance of bars and restaurants. The clock blows off steam on the quarter-hour, using a series of whistles as chimes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastown" target="_blank">Legend has it</a> that the area was established by an Englishman named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deighton" target="_blank">John Deighton</a>, who arrived with nothing but his First Nations wife and a barrel of whisky. He got a tavern built by paying men in tots of whisky and became known as 'Gassy Jack' because of his talkative nature. Other buildings were erected around the tavern and the area was subsequently named Gastown. Today, Gassy Jack has a statue.
