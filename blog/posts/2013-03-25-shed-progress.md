As if fencing, Christmas, holidays, gardening and generally having a blast didn't take up enough of our free time, we've managed to fit in some shed building. While it's been a protracted process because of all the other stuff, the actual build itself hasn't been too time consuming.

This is a shed of my own design, custom made to house wheeled equipment and our growing collection of tools.

<span style="line-height:1.5;">Initial plans to have sliding doors were ditched on cost grounds and the finished article will have folding doors, still under construction. A ramp will grace the entrance to allow the ride-on mower and tiller to be driven in and out.</span>The panels were made individually then erected in a grand shed-raising. The roof is recycled corrugated iron after we were repeatedly let down by a would-be supplier of colour steel.

Not having a concrete base to be fixed to, two large posts have been set into the ground and  bolted to the frame to prevent it from being blown away when the wind gets up. Future developments at New Bolton may require the shed to be moved, so a concrete base <span style="line-height:1.5;">was avoided.</span>
