It's a public holiday weekend in the Wellington Region, meaning we get Monday off. Bank holidays in England always seemed plagued by bad weather and that seems to be the case in NZ. We've had steady, heavy rain all day today (Sunday) with no end in sight.

The bad weather has been widespread over North Island and has caused the usual problems of flooding and land slips. On the positive side, the rain is badly need for many areas, which have been in a prolonged drought.

The forecast for next week though is much improved - when we're back at work.
