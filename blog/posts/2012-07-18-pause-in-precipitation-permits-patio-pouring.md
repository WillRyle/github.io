A spell of fine weather allowed Trev and the gang to get the patio concrete poured today. As I was at work, I could only watch via the <a title="Webcam" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/webcam/">webcams</a> as two truckloads of concrete was fashioned in to shape.

Not being on site to take photos is no barrier when there are webcams, and I used image grabs from the cameras to record the action remotely, but it will be weekend before we can see the finished result in daylight.
