I came across this remarkable story recently. It tells the story of how, in 1978,Â  a family of six was found living in isolation in the depths of Siberia. They'd been there for 40 years, having fled Bolshevik persecution of Christians in 1936, and hadn't seen or made contact with anyone in all that time.

It's a gripping tale of survival and well worth a read.
