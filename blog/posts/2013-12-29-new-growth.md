It's now four weeks since we got the <a title="Seeding" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/12/02/seeding/" target="_blank">seed down</a> for the new lawn and I optimistically thought we'd have a sea of new green grass by now. As ever, Nature doesn't cooperate with the plans of Man...<!--more-->The main problem has been a lack of rain. We've had some, but not enough and so set about watering from the big tank. That was soon exhausted though and we were reliant on the house supply until - at last - the rain found its way to us just before Christmas. With a week of rain forecast, we were able to put sprinklers and hose-pipes away and watch the grass grow. Unfortunately, it's not just the grass growing and the green we're seeing is at least equal part weeds.

Clearly, getting a respectable lawn doesn't end with seeding and we'll have to be out with fertiliser and weed killer and some point. For now though, we're enjoying a well-earned and much-needed break from our labours.<a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/004.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1807 alignright" alt="004" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/004.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="225" /></a>
