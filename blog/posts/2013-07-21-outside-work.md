The rain has held off for long enough for the ground to dry to a point where it's possible to work without turning into a mud bath. With a bit of sunshine for a change, it was time to put the tiller to work.

Tilling was relatively quick and painless as the remnants of the corn crop were dug over in barely an hour. It was then on to the vegetable patches, the smaller and more confined area against the boundary requiring a cautious approach so that fruit bushes weren't disturbed.

We had planned to put in a winter crop of green manure, but delays in getting to this stage mean it's probably too late - time to do a bit of research to find out what's best to plant.
