The <a title="Easter Ploughing" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/easter-ploughing/">Easter Ploughing Match</a> left us with the orchard area ready for levelling and seeding, and indeed we made good progress, but finished too late to take photos and write a post, a job which is now being done over a week after the event.

The result was less than impressive though, with dips and hollows that the irons weren't heavy enough to cut and fill. With time pressing due to our short hours of daylight, I decided to live with it as it was and ran the chain harrow over the ground to prepare the seed bed.

With that done, the seed spreader was pushed around until a suitable amount of seed had been dispensed. After a final harrow to cover the seed, the roller was tied to the ride-on mower and driven about, just managing to finish as the Sun disappeared behind the hills.

The next day saw it all well watered in as we got over an inch of rain. With luck, the warm and wet will continue and by next weekend we should see some growth.
