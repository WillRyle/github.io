The humble fence is a simple structure, just posts in the ground and rails between them. Watching Neale at work though, I came to realise that there's more to fencing than what's above ground.

With the main boundary fences in place, work began on making good the existing fences that border neighbouring properties. For this we used wire sheep netting stretched between 'strainer' posts with additional support from 'Y' section metal fence posts. After that was completed, the next fencing job was installing the wind breaks that will protect the vegetable plots and provide support for fruit trees and bushes.

We'd had a go at putting in some wind breaks ourselves, but our efforts weren't up to standard for the notorious Featherston winds, as they've developed a distinct lean and the wind break material has chafed through and failed in places. This is clearly a job for the experienced and so was added to Neale's list of tasks.

The new wind breaks will have strainer posts at each end and smaller diameter wooden posts in between. To better support the wind break material, chicken wire will be stretched along its length. Additional wires on the downwind side will allow fruit trees to be trained espalier style.

Because of the tension in the wire, the strainer posts are braced by stays to prevent them being pulled inwards and causing the wire to slacken. This is quite a common arrangement, but the first time I'd seen how they were installed. A notch is cut in the strainer post and the stay is keyed to fit. At the ground end, a hole is dug and a footer piece of timber placed across. The stay is positioned in the notch and the other end made a tight fit and hammered into place against the footer.

The hole is filled and the strainer post at the other end of the fence run is given the same treatment. The smaller diameter posts are installed at regular intervals between the strainer posts then two wires are tensioned to carry the top and bottom of the netting.

The chicken wire will prevent this material from billowing and sagging in the wind[/caption]

The result is a neat job with well tensioned chicken wire ready to support the wind break material.Â  Two other similar structures are scheduled to be installed to replace our home-made efforts. A failed wind break can be seen in the background of the photo on the left.
