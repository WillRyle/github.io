It's past mid-winter and has been mild so far, but today we woke to clear skies and what passes in these parts for a significant frost.

<p style="text-align:center;">It didn't last long though, the sun soon warming us up. The design and orientation of the house makes good use of solar energy, to the point that by mid afternoon we had to open windows to avoid overheating.</p>
