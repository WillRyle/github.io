Today was the second day of persistent rain which has delayed the completion of the roof. This has happened at just the wrong time - having the roof on and windows installed marks the half way point in the build, from which the builder can give us a completion date as the remaining work is not weather dependent. It was hoped that we'd be at that stage by the end of this week and with a favourable forecast for the rest of the week, we may yet get there.

While nothing happened on site on Tuesday, today has seen some progress inside with a number of ceiling battens added and other detail work around door openings.
