Our move to New Zealand reached its logical conclusion this week. A simple ceremony with other like-minded individuals saw a slight increase in the country's citizens.

We'd applied for NZ citizenship late last year and had been accepted just before Christmas, but this is not confirmed until the oath of allegiance has been taken and being Wairarapa, it takes a while to get enough people for a worthwhile ceremony.

On Wednesday we joined with a dozen or so other candidates in Greytown, the mayor of South Wairarapa officiating and friends Pete &amp; Sue in support, as we swore to be faithful to the Queen of New Zealand.

We've both served the Crown and taken the Queen's shilling as British citizens, so taking the pledge to the same woman didn't give us pause for thought. Not for nothing were ex-patriot Britons excused the oath in earlier times.

With the formalities over, we adjourned to the local hostelry and finalised plans for a celebration with friends and neighbours this weekend - appropriately extended by the Queen's Birthday public holiday and coincidentally, the third year since <a title="Mission Accomplished" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/06/05/mission-accomplished/">moving into New Bolton</a>.
