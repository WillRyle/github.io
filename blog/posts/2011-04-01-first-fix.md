With the doors and windows locked and not having a key, we're reduced to peering through the windows to check on progress until we get a key.

<p style="text-align:left;">What we've seen though is all good. Adding to the electrician's good work, the plumber has made his mark with pipework appearing in reassuring quantities.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Outside, the base for the pool equipment shed makes parallel progress - the electrician having placed his power conduit, the plumber follows suit by adding the link between pool and pumps. Next will be the concrete and with the frames all ready and waiting, I expect the shed to appear in short order.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If the weather holds good this weekend, we'll continue our task of removing the unwanted remains of the poplar boundary hedge and making as much of the section as possible 'mower friendly' to reduce maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Our clocks go back an hour on Saturday night as we approach Autumn and already the grass is noticeably slowing from its vigorous Summer growth. From then on we'll be BST + 11hours, for those of you thinking of telephoning.</p>
