The days are getting longer as Spring gets underway and we're getting a useful amount daylight. Add to that the drier weather and a we have suitable conditions for doing outdoor work - getting ready for the spring vegetable planting and preparatory work in anticipation of Steve turning up with his Clydesdales.

My job is to turn over those parts of the section that had tree stumps - although they've been removed, some roots remain. To reduce the risk of damage to the plough, I've been finding them with the tiller which does a good job as a root detector.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tilling-011.jpg" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-1306 aligncenter" title="Tilling Panorama" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tilling-011.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="266" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There's more to do, of course, but the part I have done is the toughest, being full of roots, junk, a long cast iron pipe and sundry garbage from adjoining properties deposited during the lengthy period when our section was derelict.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In the vege area, I tilled over the third of our sectioned growing areas in preparation for the new growing season.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">This is the largest patch so far and is likely to be planted with potatoes. Our winter veg in the picture on the right hasn't been so productive. The cabbage, broccoli and brussels didn't recover after being savaged by the caterpillars and being subject to the persistent wet weather and are going to seed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Our home-grown crop thus far has been a disappointment - the broad beans produced but a handful, the potatoes were mostly small and the tomato plants a complete washout. Not all of this was our tardiness in getting the planting done in time, but a factor of the wet summer followed by wet winter.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This season we've resolved to get better organised and at least now have the tools to help out. All we need is a Summer worthy of the name.</p>
