A gentle dusting of snow on the Rimutaka range last week. Very picturesque, but causing chaos on the roads.

Our house warming on Saturday went well and Sunday was sunny and warm.</p>
This week has seen a little action. With the weather finally meeting their exacting criteria, the painters found their way back on site to finish off the detail work on the outside, and very splendid it looks too.
