It's Labour weekend again, the start of a new growing season. Despite the wet Winter and Spring, we've had enough breaks in the weather to do some preparatory <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/plough-the-field/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ploughing</a>, tilling and harrowing on the crop area at the rear of the house and so were ready to plant out over the long weekend.

In a rather heroic effort over two days, Denise and I planted potato, sweet corn, sun flower and pumpkin in some 100 square metres. This area will be the test bed for <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/autonomous-irrigation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ALIS</a> the autonomous irrigator, on which work is progressing steadily in the workshop.

Sweet corn is a good crop for us - what doesn't get eaten fresh on the cob can be frozen or made into chutney. What doesn't make the grade for us will be snapped up by the chooks, who love the stuff. The downside is the weeding, but if the irrigator can free up some time by looking after the watering, we stand a chance of keeping on top of that. All we need now is a long hot summer.
