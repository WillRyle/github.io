If you've got two of something, is that a collection? We got our trusty ride-on mower from handy neighbour <a title="Boy’s Toys" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/12/25/boys-toys/">Doug</a>  some time ago now and it has done good work, despite the abuse it has received. When Doug acquired another very similar model, Denise immediately wanted it and has shown in the past that she can <a title="Girl’s Toys" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/girls-toys/">handle a ride-on single handed</a> as well as anyone. After a long wait, the 'new' mower has become available and we took delivery yesterday.

The Ford badge on the front is Doug's little joke, this is definitely an Australian made Cox garden tractor.

Taking a break from packing for foreign parts with the day job, Denise tried out her new garden wheels and for a time New Bolton was a-buzz with two mowers chasing each other about amid a flurry of wind-blown grass cuttings.

If two of a kind isn't a collection, it may perhaps be the start of one. Anyone got a Cox mower for sale?
