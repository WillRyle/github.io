Important steps forward with the pool installation were made this week, with both Joiner and Electrician on site, carrying out essential work in the last week before the long Christmas break.

The joiner's efforts were focused on the pool coping. I had already installed what Endless Pools calls the 'wood receiver coping'. This is essentially an aluminium extrusion that doubles as liner hanger and pool-side finish for wooden copings.

Having made a less-than-robust job of the wood coping on our last installation in England, this time I resolved to get the professionals in. Jason - for that was the pro's name - duly arrived on site to assess the situation.

After discussing the cost, complexity and conditions that the coping would have to endure, we decided on a marine ply solution. This would be two 18mm sheets, the first fixed to the pool metalwork, the second bonded to the first in such a way as to avoid 'bond-on-bond' joins and minimise the chance of warping. The finished thickness neatly filled the wood receiver and the edges were routed to take off the square corners.

Next job on the coping is drilling the holes for swim current control knob, pressure gauge and air buttons, after which several coats of yacht varnish will be applied before the wood-to-aluminium join is sealed with silicone.

Meanwhile in the Pump House, the electrician deciphered the labels on the wiring that I made when I disconnected everything four years ago and was happily rejoining the assorted pumps and heater to the electrical supply. All is very much the same as our previous installation, with the addition this time of a pool-side air button to operate the under water lights.
