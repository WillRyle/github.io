We're just back from a whistle-stop tour of Central North Island and had blast along the way. Stopping at Gravity Canyon we were roped in to a video being made by the operator as part of a promotion.

See if you can spot us in this brief clip - warning: outrageous dancing is not for those of a sensitive disposition.
