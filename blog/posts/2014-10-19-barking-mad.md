A large delivery of chipped bark was made <a title="Out of Hibernation" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/10/13/out-of-hibernation/">last weekend</a>. This was followed by an order of timber that was made good during the week. This weekend, the two were put together.

The timber is to be arranged into boxes that encompass the now completed wind breaks and filled with the bark to suppress weeds and retain moisture. The ground here soon dries and cracks and we face a constant fight against weeds. The aim is to reduce the weeding effort and water demand around the fruit trees and bushes that the wind breaks protect.

This weekend we started on the first of the boxing, Denise pulling out weeds as I knocked pegs into the ground and fixed the boards to them. We used Gus fitted with the loading tray to carry bark from the delivery point to where it was needed, but before removing the chain harrow I dragged that over the crop area at the rear of the house to complete the soil preparation that was started last weekend.

It took several loads to fill and on a relatively hot day for the time of year, we were beginning toÂ  flag when neighbour Pete turned up to help out. As the sun set we had almost filled it with bark.

Today we finished off and added a few flowers for good measure.
