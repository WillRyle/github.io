Since the <a href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/01/22/boys-toys-the-sequel/" target="_blank">acquisition of the rotary hoe</a> I've hankered for other tools that could replace the tiller and enable other labour saving work to be done. Internet searches revealed tantalising glimpses of undreamed of gadgets sourced in far away places from dodgy-sounding enterprises. Caution prevailed and the search continued until, at last...

...a New Zealand based outfit prepared to take on the quest of finding attachments was found.

This was not an easy undertaking. Over several months emails were exchanged, photos and measurements swapped, proposals were tendered and discussed with contacts in China and eventually a list of candidate attachments was obtained. After some deliberation an order was placed for a plough attachment and after a further exchange of emails a price for delivery of this to New Bolton finally obtained.

The weeks passed and eventually word was received that our consignment was in Wellington, just a hop-skip-and a jump over the Rimutaka range. More weeks passed until, released from <del>Customs</del> bondage, the plough finally turned up at New Bolton. Deep was the joy in Gadgetland, which we were able to share with our visitors from the Old Country.

Fortunately we have a <a href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/12/25/boys-toys/">Doug</a> and following a bit of drilling and turning and minor tweaks we had the thing coupled to the tiller as though they were one and we embarked on the journey from 'completely clueless about ploughing' to 'slightly less clueless about ploughing'.

Early results indicate that this is going to be a long process.
