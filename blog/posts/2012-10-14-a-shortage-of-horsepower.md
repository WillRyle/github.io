Disappointing news from Steve arrived last weekend, after a fruitless wait for him to arrive with his Clydesdales.

Owing to a change in his situation, he can't make it to plough and level the section. This comes at an awkward time, if we're to get the grass re-seeded this Spring.

Rapidly improvising a Plan B, we contacted a landscape company who came to take a look last week. They departed to price the job with the warning 'it'll cost thousands'. We've yet to receive their quote. Forewarned, we prepared Plan C.

As luck would have it, this weekend was the Wairarapa Ploughing Match at Gladstone, which seemed the ideal venue to make contact with people with the equipment to do the job. Sure enough, we came away after having exchanged details with a leading light in the South Wairarapa ploughing scene and slightly more optimistic about getting the work done in the Spring.
