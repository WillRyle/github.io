New Zealanders always seem to make Christmas a big event. Perhaps because it signals the start of Summer Holidays as much as a traditional festival. Every town worthy of the name will hold a Christmas Parade, where businesses and community organisations get to strut their stuff down the main street.

Some towns jump the gun in my view, having their parades in November which strikes me as a bit early, but then the child-like anticipation of the festivities seems to infect the adult population as well and it's common to see shops and businesses bedecked with decorations and public spaces sporting Christmas trees well before December.

Featherston, being a modestly sized township, put on an appropriately modest but well attended parade.

It was slightly bizarre in places, featuring Shrek and Donkey - the donkey was real - and a man in a day-glo one-piece body suit.

A popular attraction was <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Taungatara" target="_blank">Steve with his Clydesdales</a> and notÂ unsurprisingly, Father Christmas who closed the show riding on a vintage fire engine.
