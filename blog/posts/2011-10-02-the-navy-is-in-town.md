It's 70 years since the formation of the Royal New Zealand Navy and exercises to mark the event included a visit to Wellington for all but one the RNZN's 12 ships. It could be argued that a dozen ships hardly qualifies as a navy, but with defence cuts reducing the Royal Navy's ship numbers, my guess is that <em>per capita</em> NZ has the biggest fleet, in terms of numbers if not in tonnage.

I took a walk down to the harbour at lunch time on Friday to have a look...

I only had time for photos of the Canterbury and TeKaha, two of the larger ships, the others were tucked along Wellington's extensive water front.

Heading back to work, I took the opportunity to photograph my destination, the immodestly named Majestic Centre.
