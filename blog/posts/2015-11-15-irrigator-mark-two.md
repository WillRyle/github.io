Following the success of the first <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/irrigation/" target="_blank">irrigation contraption</a> and the acquisition of a <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2015/04/27/donor-vehicle/" target="_blank">donor vehicle</a>, the second iteration of our bespoke watering solution is ready for the summer growing season.

It was originally planned to motorise each trolley of the linear irrigator, but this led to the issue of preventing one trolley moving at a different speed or direction to the other and involved the work of dismantling the scooter and starting from scratch. By using the scooter as it was, these issues were avoided. To this end, the chosen configuration uses a counter-weighted spray boom to give a 3.5 metre coverage to one side. This layout was chosen to allow the irrigator to travel in the 'dead' ground near the trees, an area that has its moisture sucked out by the trees, leaving the soil dry and dusty.

In operation, the irrigator is driven from row to row by using the scooter forward and back controls. An in-line hose timer is then set to the appropriate watering duration at which point the gadget can be left to complete watering before being 'driven' to the next row.

This arrangement means watering can be undertaken with minimal effort from one operator and allows other tasks to be performed until the timer switches off. One addition yet to be made is a retractable hose reel to pay out and wind up as the irrigator is moved to prevent it tangling the hose. Also to be done is fixing the steering wheels to keep it on a straight path, simplifying operation further. If this season's 'proof of concept' works out well, the next version may well feature totally autonomous operation as I investigate the possibility of computer controlling the scooter and water control to give us a watering robot.
