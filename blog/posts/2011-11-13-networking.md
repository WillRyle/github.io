The recent apparent hiatus in activity at New Bolton masks a certain background activity that precedes the busy period of any project.

<!--more-->With several jobs that all need to be done in fairly short order, it's necessary to ensure that they are executed in the correct sequence, with local tradesmen and locally sourced materials, at the best price and without blowing the budget.

The jobs include fencing (65 metres of post-and-rail to start and about 100 metres of post-and-wire to follow), turning over the ground (rotary hoeing soil that hasn't been dug in years), adding fertiliser and digging it in (spreading horse manure and rotary hoeing again), levelling (dragging iron bars about), seeding the new lawn area and planting out the new veggie plots. That's all before we start planting the orchard and fruit bushes. Then there's the deck around the house and the pool to install when the parts arrive from the U.S. (now somewhere in the Pacific after passing through the Panama Canal)

It so happens that a neighbour was a fencing contractor who had a good deal going with a local timber merchant, so that was one item sorted. It turns out that just about every local in the Wairarapa has some fencing experience and we were inundated with offers of fencers.
<p style="text-align:left;">Next was turning the soil. Ideally, this should be done before fencing, so that we can get right up to the boundary and we thought the answer was the use of a <a title="Clydesdales" href="http://www.facebook.com/Taungatara" target="_blank">local who could use a team of Clydesdales</a> to plough, disc and level the section. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Taungatara?sk=photos" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" title="Taungatara Clydesdales" src="http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/215360_158889127505692_146737065387565_345732_1362785_n.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" /></a>Unfortunately the large clods of dirt we're left with would be too tough for his equipment, so it looks like we'll have to resort to tractor and rotary hoe. We may yet see these sturdy beast at New Bolton though - where there are horses there's horse manure and we'll need that by the trailer load, so there's a chance we can get the fertiliser delivered and dug in using the traditional method.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">With the horses unable to turn the ground over, we've had to find a local with the equipment and inclination to do the job and this weekend, after several dead leads, we're close to having that organised. Hopefully our ducks are all lined up and the coming weeks will see them all knocked over in short order.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, on the ground we've had a neighbour's young lad earn his pocket money by keeping the grass under control using his dad's ride-on mower, while I've been cutting back the long grass too rough to ride over.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">With all this attention, the ground hasn't looked so good in a long while.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Elsewhere, steady progress is the order of the day. Our shipment of parts for the pool makes its way across the vast Pacific. Being out of range of <a href="http://marinetraffic.com/ais/" target="_blank">Marinetraffic.com</a>, the next we're likely to hear of it is when it appears off shore from Auckland about the 20th November. While we're waiting, preparations are ongoing, the latest being a lick of paint for the equipment shed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/paint-and-trim-021.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-841" title="Paint and Trim 021" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/paint-and-trim-021.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/paint-and-trim-029.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-842" title="Paint and Trim 029" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/paint-and-trim-029.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As it that weren't enough, the house itself is not being neglected as arrangements are made for the deck that will all but surround the building, providing outdoor space for the pool room, living room and kitchen and likely to be done by another neighbour.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is arguably the most intensive networking exercise I've yet had to undertake.</p>
