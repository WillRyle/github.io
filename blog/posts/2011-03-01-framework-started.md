A complete change on site today as the builders erect the frames that form the house structure.

This is a common form of construction in New Zealand and slightly odd to those of us who are more used to the brick &amp; mortar houses of colder and damper climates. What I find most bizarre is that the roof of metal sheet will be fitted before the cladding goes over the frames, giving the impression that the house is being built from the top down.

Our next decision comes on Thursday, when we meet on site to determine the final position of doors and windows. One advantage of the timber frame is the ability to swap them around before final fixing. Another advantage is that come a big quake, there aren't tons of masonry above your head, something brought into sharp focus by the Christchurch disaster.
