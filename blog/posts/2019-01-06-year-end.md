Another year over and a long overdue post to document the latest events. There was more tree planting and we've had the builders on site again.

<!--more-->The last tree to add to the orchard before the expected hot and dry of Summer was a Damson. These small plums are a great fruit for all manner of jams and wine making. As it turned out, we could have carried on planting trees right up until Christmas as Spring was a wet affair lightened only by the odd sunny day. Christmas day was dull and overcast with low cloud obscuring the hills. Inside though, the feasting and festivities were in top form with a turkey and ham dinner to share with friends.

This gives us an under cover area outdoors sheltered from sun and rain and has already proved its worth in that regard. The structure has lighting for when outdoor events run into the evening and as a bonus the roof increases the rainwater catchment that fills the tank.

With the experience of last year, a slightly better job was made this time, but there's still a lot to learn about this ploughing thing.

Also in work recently is ALIS, our irrigation contraption. Last season finished with it requiring more work to get it to track up and down the veggie patch reliably. Guide wheels had been added front and rear which improved things slightly, but this season had the guide track moved further away from the trees. Running the irrigator up and down the new track is still giving problems, even after improving the installation of the rear guide wheels. I will persist with the guide track a bit longer, but I'm already looking towards plan 'B' - an alternative using rails. This option will necessitate a radical rework of the irrigator device altogether, so I need to investigate its feasibility first.
