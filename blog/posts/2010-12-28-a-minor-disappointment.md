...that the build didn't get to start before the Christmas break. Strong winds and rain at the crucial time are likely to blame, the wind being strong enough to roll the bales of hay around the section.

After a hot and sunny Christmas day, we now have the wind and rain back, coupled with a power cut overnight that had us digging out the camping stove to make the first brew this morning. My plans to include a Transfer Switch in the new build to allow a standby generator to be connected seems like an even better idea now.

Denise came to the aid of a distressed Tui yesterday - <a title="New Zealand's Birds" href="http://labarker.com/NZbirds.html" target="_blank">the feathered kind</a>, not the <a title="Tui Brewery Website" href="http://www.tui.co.nz/" target="_blank">local brew</a> with its cynical "Yeah right" adverts.

The bird was unable to fly for some reason and the neighbour's cat was taking an unduly close interest, despite being chased off. Denise picked up the hapless bird and put it in a Greengage tree, where it scurried up to a high branch and was later seen feeding of the abundant fruit. It has been spotted today, hanging on for dear life in the strong winds.
