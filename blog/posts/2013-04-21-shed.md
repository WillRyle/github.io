Another minor landmark passed un-commented recently - the completion of the shed. Complete in this context doesn't actually mean there's nothing else to do on it, but rather it's fully functional as a secure, weather proof store for the tools and machinery we've accumulated over the last five years.

A brief to-do list will include the manufacture of a ramp to allow easy access for wheeled vehicles, another coat of paint on the iron roof and flashings, additional shelving and fixing of tools, guttering to fill another water-butt and maybe a coat of paint to better match the house.

The double folding doors work well and are arranged to allow quick access to the shed without the need to open them all. Also

important is the cost - hinges and securing bolts being significantly cheaper than the hardware required for the sliding option I was considering.

We've freed up space in the pump-house by moving tools from there into the new shedÂ and so move a bit closer to getting properly organised.

The problem is that 'stuff' accumulates to fill any available space and with the acquisition of Gus and a concrete mixer, plus our trusty van all still needing shelter from the elements, we're going to have to think bigger to solve our storage and garaging issues.

As you'd expect, 'Plans are afoot', but it's too early to say how they'll manifest themselves. For now just note that we have neighbours who build stuff.
