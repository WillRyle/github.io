From the 'only in New Zealand' department, news that a <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/agriculture/news/article.cfm?c_id=16&amp;objectid=10738848&amp;ref=nzwtage" target="_blank">sheep was found running around Wellington city centre</a>Â one night last week.

Collared by members of the public, the hapless creature was taken away by police and spent the night in custody before being handed over to Animal Control the next day.

Police were at a loss to explain where the animal came from. Truly, you can't make this stuff up.
