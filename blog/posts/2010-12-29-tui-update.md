Our adopted tui is still with us. The weather is being a lot kinder to it and it seems to be enjoying feeding on the copious plums in the tree. I took some photos, but struggled to get a good shot, the best of the bunch are shown below (click for larger images).

It's not clear if this is a young bird that's flown the nest too early, or an elderly one on its last legs. There are no signs of any parent birds and it isn't making any attempt to fly, but still doesn't seem distressed or injured. For now though, it's out of harm's way and we will watch for further developments.
