Following on from yesterday's mini adventure in Sydney, I headed of in a different direction today, just making it up as I went along. A sort of purposeful aimlessness to my step, the map in my pocket going unread.

Without too much effort I found myself approaching Darling Harbour, walking across Pyrmont Bridge with the monorail sailing by overhead. (click any picture to see a larger version of it).

Not for the first time since I arrived I marvelled at how the city had grown from zero to what I saw now in scarcely 200 years. Below me I saw the Maritime Museum complete with real life-size ships in the water, which I deemed worthy of closer inspection.

Amongst the floating exhibits was a destroyer, HMAS Vampire and an Oberon class submarine HMAS Onslow, both now retired from the Royal Australian Navy.

Resisting the temptation to go aboard the ship and submarine - I knew I'd be there for hours if I did - I walked around the harbour, almost overdosing on the modern architecture, artworks, water features and bizarre water craft that seemed to fill every available space.

I reached the end of the harbour and there was the ferry terminal. Sydney harbour has an extensive ferry service and the constant comings and goings of ferries, water taxis and tour craft give the waterways a busy air. Although I could have easily walked back, I took the opportunity to get water-borne with the aim of getting photos from a different perspective. I wasn't disappointed. The ferry didn't go direct to the city centre wharf, but stopped several times including crossing the harbour to pick up from the far side.

The more adventurous can walk to the top of the bridge's arch (where the flags are) and I saw groups of people making the trek on more than one occasion. I did wonder what the wind speed was like at that elevation, it being windy enough at sea level today.</p>
