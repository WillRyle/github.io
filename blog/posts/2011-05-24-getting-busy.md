I made a site visit this morning before heading off to work and was glad to see the place a hive of activity.

Yesterday the trenches for drainage pipes were dug, along with a large pit for the pumped sewage tank, leaving the rear of the house looking like a set for "All Quiet on the Western Front".

A float switch activates a pump sending it into the main sewer. This arrangement was necessary because there is insufficient fall for gravity to do its work between the house and the mains.

Another large hole has appeared today. This is the soak pit for the rainwater. The downspouts are piped in to the soak pit where the water can run off into the ground. Future work will see the addition of an above ground rainwater storage tank, the contents of which will be used to water the garden. The pipes will then be routed to the tank with the overflow returning to the soak pit.

The inside has also seen significant progress. The painters have given the entire house two coats of paint and the tiler completed grouting his work this morning in time for the fire guys to fit the wood burner and its flue. The plumber has also been installing the major bathroom components.

Still to come this week are the electrician, who should have us powered up by Friday, and the carpet fitters who will be laying the vinyl flooring.
