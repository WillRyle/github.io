This week has seen the plasterers complete their work and the builders are back on site. We've seen skirting boards fitted on the inside and the completion of the base for the equipment shed outside. We have gutters and the painter is literally leaving his mark on the weather board.

Other surprises are the arrival of the kitchen, with a good number of the cabinets already installed and the delivery of the bathroom equipment, resulting in the house now filling with boxes. Meanwhile all the internal doors have been removed and sent for spray painting. This is the accepted approach it seems, spraying being quicker and resulting in a better finish.

Photos and videos to follow at the weekend, the only time we get to see the house in the daylight.
