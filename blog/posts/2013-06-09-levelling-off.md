The ongoing <a title="Raking ItÂ Off" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/1635/">ground levelling saga</a> continued last weekend. Some levelling irons had been sourced at a nearby hire shop, but getting them was postponed for two weekends owing to bad weather which left the soil too wet to work with.

Queen's Birthday weekend saw more favourable conditions and the irons were duly obtained and put to work.

There are still the natural undulations in the ground but no bumps and hollows to throw the unsuspecting out of the ride-on lawnmower. I even did a test run in the ride-on to make sure.

The next stage is going over the ground with a chain harrow to create a seed bed and finding one of these is also proving problematic - the hire shop don't do chain harrows. I've trawled Trade Me for second-hand ones to no avail, at least locally. so may have to resort to buying one.
