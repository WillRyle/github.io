This is our first Kiwi Christmas in our own home. It's also one where we've no travel plans, so the motivation for something more traditional is with us this year. After today's Christmas parade, we realised that time was short and the holiday will soon be upon us. Time then, to get into the Christmas spirit.

After the day's work on the pool, a drive to the local Christmas tree vendor was in order. We walked around the paddock until we found a Norwegian Spruce that looked a good fit, there was a brief buzz of a chainsaw and we were soon driving home with a freshly cut tree.

The finished article was soon looking suitably festive.
