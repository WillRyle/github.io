With only the hydraulics left to commission, I forsook Friday drinks with workmates for an early dart home to get the swim current working. I had the pipework done and the reservoir filled before tea, but was too hungry and too hot to continue...

After the break it was just a case of connecting the air button pipe and pushing the button. With the last few days of troubles still a recent memory, it was a pleasant surprise to hear 6 horse power of hydraulic motor come to life. After letting the pipes fill with fluid I turned the swim current to full speed for the customary max-pressure leak check. A few nips of the spanner and a top up of hydraulic fluid saw all in working order.

By now I was hot with the evening sun on the pool room, the pool was open and the current Â running. Although the water temperature was only 20c, there was clearly only one thing to do.
