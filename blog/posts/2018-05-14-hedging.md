A busy weekend despite the poor weather saw us split our time between the garden and volunteering to help out at Featherston's fourth BookTown event.

The hedging we started last weekend was completed on Saturday, the rain kindly holding off until we'd finished. When grown, it's hoped it will shelter the orchard area at the front of the section from the prevailing North Westerlies and the odd Southerly.

Sunday was given over to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/featherstonbooktown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Featherston BookTown</a>, where Denise worked collecting <a href="http://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?&amp;keywords=koha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>koha</em></a> at one of the event venues; and I - together with neighbour Pete - acted as runners, picking up the contributions and distributing food and drinks to the volunteers. This has been an increasingly popular event for visitors and locals alike, with a large degree of community involvement.

With the hedge now complete, we can focus on selecting and planting fruit trees. Also an option here are nut trees - almond, walnut and hazelnut are all popular choices - as well as citrus and the never-before-heard-of persimmon.
