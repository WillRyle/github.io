Last week marked the end of daylight savings time in New Zealand and with it the end of summer. As if to mark the occasion, we had our second annual Sweetcorn Harvest, in temperatures not far off from the summertime peak.

We deliberately planted a lot less sweetcorn this year, having discovered how labour intensive growing the stuff is. The yield was much better though, which we can attribute to a number of factors - a different plot was used with better soil, the seed was planted sooner and the smaller area was easier to keep weeded.

A repeat of <a title="Sweet Corn Festival" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/04/28/sweetcorn-festival/">last year's harvest festival</a> resulted in bags of sweetcorn in the freezer. A delightful Tuna &amp; Sweetcorn Flan was produced and with the kitchen too hot for comfort, further culinary efforts were postponed. The afternoon drifted into wine on the patio and Boules on lawn until the sun disappeared behind the Rimutakas, then rounded off with an evening movie matin√©e featuring <a href="http://www.theitalianjob.com/index.htm" target="_blank">The Italian Job</a>.

No sooner were we back at work the next week when the rain came and didn't go away until today, depositing four inches of the wet stuff during the course of its visit. The rain was much-needed by our lawn which is now looking much greener for it - and the copious amounts of Weed &amp; Feed that it's been treated to.

We've still got the orchard area to seed, but prior to that the ground needs preparation. The Roundup has already been applied and the weeds are quietly dying off. To bury them I intend to use the new <a title="More Toys" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/more-toys/">plough attachment</a> for the walk-behind tractor and have proposed a Ploughing Match with friends. The quest for the straightest furrow and best ploughman in New Bolton should take place over the Easter break, weather permitting. First Prize will be a bag of frozen sweetcorn.
