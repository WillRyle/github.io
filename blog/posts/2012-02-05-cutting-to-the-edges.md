Ordinarily, summers in the Wairarapa are hot and dry. This year, like the last, has been somewhat different. The occasional hot spell has been interspersed with either very wet - two days of continuous rain - or windy - two days of continuous high winds. The last few weeks have been warm enough, but with sufficient rain to make the grass grow so fast you can almost see it. These are great conditions for farmers who have, literally, been making hay.

For us, on the other hand, the extra growth gets in the way of our attempts to shape New Bolton into our image. We're attempting to turn the ground, remove tree roots and large stones and make ready for re-seeding. The good news is we've now got the means to keep things under control and the ride-on mower has been put to good work this weekend.

In addition to controlling the new growth, we've cut back the remaining long grass with it and for the first time the entire section has been trimmed from boundary to boundary.

Use of the mower was necessary after the line trimmer expired, following a catastrophic failure in the engine department. Although less than two years old, it had been put to hard use and the demands made of it were too much. That its demise followed Denise's regular use of it lately is merely accidental. Maybe.

On a positive note, ever-helpful neighbour Doug has a replacement available that will be better suited to our needs.

Our other machine has also been working hard this weekend, the tiller doing a sterling job of turning over ground that had earlier had tree stumps removed.
