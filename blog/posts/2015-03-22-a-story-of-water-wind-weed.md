It was officially Autumn on 1st March. Nature had other ideas and the warm, dry weather continued for another two weeks or so and we only saw a change when the remnants of Cyclone Pam paid a visit bringing some rain and a noticeably cooler air. The chimneys of Featherston - idle for many months now - were seen smoking as the new heating season started.

<!--more-->It's been the driest and hottest summer in our short time here, though more typical of Wairarapa historically, according to longer term residents. This has brought its own challenges in the garden, my best response being the <a title="Irrigation" href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/irrigation/">irrigation contraption</a> to help with watering the veggies. Another challenge was dealing with the wind. The days would typically start mild, but as the temperature rose so did thermal activity, giving strong and turbulent winds. These in turn flattened the sweet corn and unearthed the potatoes, scorched the vegetation and dried the soil even more.

Incredibly, despite the hot and dry, the weeds continued to grow. The lawn was parched and burnt brown, but with tall weeds flowering and threatening to seed more of themselves. Rows of veggies were swamped by weeds which easily won the battle for moisture and nutrients and spoiled our ambitions for a plentiful harvest. Despite this we had some success. The early potatoes yielded a better crop than last year and the main crop is looking promising. Beans and peas produced enough for several meals and were especially tasty given the effort they took. We have a few promising pumpkin and squash, though not nearly as many as were planted - a rather poor 'strike rate'. Of the hundred or so sweet corn seeds planted, about half remain and if the weather stays mild for a few more weeks we may get some useful cobs from them. On the other side of the balance sheet, the parsnips never made it above ground, a few beetroot plants might make it to maturity, salads were overpowered by sun and weed and carrots and other crops are stunted and not likely to yield much edible.

All told then, a lacklustre performance from the veggies but a good lesson for us in dealing with a more typical Wairarapa summer. The water tank came in to its own and with the addition of a contents gauge we are learning how much each watering session costs in litres in the tank and how much each millimetre of rain yields in its replenishment. This data will inform our decisions regarding future capacity - that is do we need to add an extra water tank if we put more garden under cultivation.

While we've worked hard to try to maximise yields, the conditions have relieved us of some work - mowing the grass. Apart from the occasional whizz over to keep the weeds in check, the ride-on mowers have been idle - a huge time saver compared to last year. We're formulating ideas to make good on the lessons learned - better soil condition to retain moisture, some form of wind protection for the crop area at the rear of the house and extending the irrigation system to other parts of the garden. Plans are in hand - we're not going to give up the battle so easily.
