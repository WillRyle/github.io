<a title="The Big Wet" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/the-big-wet/">Bemoaning</a> the lack of good weather to get the ride-on into action, I observed that the grass was growing unchecked, if somewhat slowly. Our neighbours on the other hand, had sheep that were getting more vocal because of the shortage of good grazing. The solution was obvious...

I extracted the <a href="http://www.gallagher.co.nz/smartfence/" target="_blank">SmartFence</a> from its corner of the shed and strung it some distance from our boundary with the neighbour. This is where we've <a title="Sweet Corn" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2012/12/29/sweet-corn/">grown crops</a> in the past and dumped the dead grass from the <a title="Groundwork" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/11/19/groundwork/">ground work</a> to compost away. It's mostly weed and paddock grass but the sheep don't seem to mind. They were brought in and after a brief period of looking, err.. sheepish, got stuck in to the new and relatively abundant food.

This is the first livestock we've had since <a title="Introducing Josh" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/08/07/introducing-josh/">Josh the goat</a> (recently departed, by the way, after getting to be too much of a handful but leaving some cute-as babies behind).

It's a timely move for both us and the neighbours. Their grass has time to grow as Spring makes itself felt and we get the weeds eaten and grass mown, doubtless with a generous sprinkling of fertilizer, in <a href="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/livestock-014.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1974 size-medium" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/livestock-014.jpg?w=300" alt="Livestock 014" width="300" height="225" /></a>anticipation of planting the next crop.<a href="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/livestock-021.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1978 size-large" src="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/livestock-021.jpg?w=640" alt="Livestock 021" width="640" height="480" /></a>
