Now we've put the clock back in anticipation of the onset of Winter's shorter days, our evening visits to the section after work are in darkness. Until we get access and are able to take photos of the inside, there will be a shortage of pictures.

By way of compensation, I've put together a video animation of the build's progress thus far - a rough time-lapse spanning about 3 months - condensed into one and a half minutes.
