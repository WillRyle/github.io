So, the clocks go forward to herald in the Summer and what happens? Well, apart from forgetting to change the clocks and lying in far too late, the heavens opened and it has rained continuously, only now - late on Sunday afternoon - has the sky run out of the wet stuff.

We'd even bought seed potatoes in the hope of getting those planted today - these are earlies and if got in on time will give new potatoes for Christmas dinner.

On the positive side, yesterday we managed to get the main lawn cut, the grass being reasonably dry because of a strong wind. Problems with the ride-on delayed matters though, so we ran out of time to get the veggie plot ready for the spuds.

At the back of the house, the sheep have gone home leaving a manicured and manured area easily distinguished from the rest. I particularly like the way they trim the grass right up to the fence, they really do seem to suffer from that 'grass is always greener on the other side' syndrome.

Another job that has gone undone due to the wetÂ  was preparing our crop area - harrowing the sheep manure and tilling the compost in ready for planting up with pumpkin, peas and broad beans.

It looks like we'll be busy next weekend - weather permitting.
