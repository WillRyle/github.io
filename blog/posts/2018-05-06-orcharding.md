More progress at last on the orchard this weekend. We'd made a start recently with the first olive trees and more planned. We made good on this by planting the second batch of olives and then a bit more...

The olives are planted in parallel rows on the diagonal of the section that doubles as our archery range. When grown we will be shooting arrows down an avenue of olives.

Today's effort has been planting a hedge along the front boundary. We came away from a local nursery yesterday with 56 Olearia Dartonii (twiggy tree daisy)Â  plants and managed to get in 34 on one side of the entrance that will hopefully form a wind break for the fruit trees planted behind. The fast growing plants were set at 1 metre intervals and will be allowed to grow to about 6 foot high then trimmed to form a thick bushy hedge.

Next weekend's job will be planting the hedging on the other side of the entrance - only half the number of plants this time - and using any leftover plants to turn the hedge down the driveway.
