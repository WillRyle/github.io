Sad news reached us from Germany at the weekend. The chef of The Royal hotel in Featherson, Ulli Reinhart, had died while on holiday visiting relatives.

Ulli and partner Dean Davies are popular hosts and made a good team, with Dean looking after the front of house and Ulli sending top quality food out of the kitchen. We've enjoyed their hospitality many times and will miss Ulli.
