Checking the build's progress this evening and half expecting to see some of the roof on, we were a little surprised to note that work had started on cladding the rear wall.

We'll take any progress we get though and aren't too fussy about the build sequence. With the cladding started, the finished look of the house is becoming apparent. We had the choice of brick cladding but opted for weatherboard, preferring the traditional Kiwi look which is especially common in the Wairarapa.
