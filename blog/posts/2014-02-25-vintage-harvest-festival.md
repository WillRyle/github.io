While we're always off to one event or another during the Summer, the Vintage Harvest Festival in nearby Carterton is one that we've always managed to miss. We put this right on Sunday and - in the company of Pete and Geoff - had a <a title="A GoodÂ Day" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/02/23/a-good-day/">good day</a> out.

<!--more-->The event turned out to be an extravaganza of vintage farming technology and machinery in general from Clydesdale horses to massive bulldozers. A central arena held events including two I'd never witnessed before - a tug of war between a steam-powered traction engine and a large more modern tractor and a race between four steam engines. Check out the videos below.

I was particularly impressed by the tug of war where the steam engine's front wheels lift off the ground.

Elsewhere the action continued with the Clydesdales ploughing and wheat being threshed and the straw baled, all by vintage machinery.
