While in Sydney with the day job, I had given some thought to nipping over to Perth at the weekend to visit relatives. Checking the flights however and noting the size of Australia, I soon came to the conclusion that I wouldn't be nipping anywhere, Perth being a 5-hour flight to the opposite side of the country. With the tyranny of distance doing its work, I opted instead to spend the weekend in Sydney rather than sat on aeroplanes.

It's certainly an impressive city - spacious, clean and modern. It's also big and busy during the week and not much quieter at weekend. On Saturday I took a walk down to the Sydney Opera House, which on closer inspection turns out to be a number of separate halls.

I peeked inside to find it all rather ordinary, like a conference centre anywhere else, though I didn't do the guided tour. Next I headed off to The Rocks, Sydney's old town.

It being Saturday, some of the streets were closed to traffic to allow the market to operate and a large number of stalls were open selling all  manner of stuff of varying quality and usefulness.

Getting hungry, I found a restaurant that wasn't too busy and feasted on fillet steak and a commendable Shiraz.

Concluding that this important heritage couldn't be left out of any tour of The Rocks, I called in to inspect the premises and sample the beers on offer. I'm happy to report that the atmosphere is convivial and the beers varied and cold.
