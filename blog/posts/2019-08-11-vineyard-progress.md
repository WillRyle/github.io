Neale has been making steady progress on the vineyard structure while we've been at work - aided by neighbour Pete, all the strainer post stays are now in place.

Come the weekend, with bad weather expected, there was just time for me to learn how to fix the first of the wires that will form a trellis for the vines to grow along. We fixed the 'fruiting wires' to all five rows. These are the wires along which the vines will be trained horizontally, sending out vertical shoots to form the canopy.

At this stage of construction, the fruiting wires will allow the vineyard posts - additional support between the strainer posts - to be accurately placed, a job Neale and Pete will tackle during the week, picking a fine day to do the post hole boring.

With the vineyard posts installed the remaining wire can be attached. The lowest of these will carry irrigation pipes and above the fruiting wire a number of training wires will support the canopy. With a fair wind, it looks like we'll be ready for planting when the vines arrive at the end of this month.

Strainer posts with stays fitted, fruiting wires are tensioned and the vineyard posts lie about waiting for the hole borer.[/caption]
