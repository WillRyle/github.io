Another long pause between blog posts, but that's not a sign that we've got our feet up, fire on and wine glass in hand as another Winter comes around.

<!--more-->In between the wet weather, colds and the day jobs, we've been busy about the place with assorted projects.

<a href="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/wp_20190512_14_14_56_pro.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2608" src="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/wp_20190512_14_14_56_pro.jpg?w=169" alt="" width="169" height="300" /></a>The feijoa harvest was bountiful and a good 6kg was pulped and turned into cider. Neighbour Pete had his house picked up and turned around, which led to several working bees. New hedging has been planted to screen the rear of the house, Denise having planted another good quantity of seedlings.

As if that wasn't enough, plans for our vineyard are advancing apace. 54 pinot noir vines of 2 varieties are on order and scheduled for delivery at the end of August and the material to create the supporting infrastructure will arrive imminently. With a trip overseas planned, we'll have a busy time when we get back putting up the posts and wires then planting the vines.

Not any old chook house of course, this will have a camera to keep an eye on things from work, a daylight sensor that determines when to open the door - which is automated using the bones of a dead scanner - and lights to dupe the birds into thinking it's earlier than it is in Winter.Â The aim of the automated door opening is so we don't have to surface early during Summer weekends, when the chooks are complaining loudly at 6am to be let out.

But wait - there's more! The orchard is set to grow some more with a new tranche of trees on order this time a mix of fruit and nuts. These are also likely to arrive in August, so we're going to be even busier - blogging may be light for a while...
