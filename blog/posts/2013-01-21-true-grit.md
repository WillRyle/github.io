In the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/8204365/Woman-completes-Cook-to-Cook-journey" target="_blank">News </a>today the story of a heroic feat of endurance and stamina in what's called the Cook To Cook challenge. The heroine of the hour is a lady by the name of Sara Wilson who, at 48 years of age, has just completed a journey that almost killed her 14 months ago.

The challenge involves climbing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoraki_/_Mount_Cook" target="_blank">Mount Cook</a>, which happens to be the highest mountain in New Zealand reaching 3,754 metres (12,316 ft).  After that little jaunt, the next leg is a cycle ride to Picton, a mere 770 kilometres (478 miles)  from Mount Cook village. Having arrived at the port of Picton, don't take the ferry like everyone else, but spend two days in a kayak paddling across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Strait" target="_blank">Cook Strait</a> described as "one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world."

Who thinks this stuff up? Who thought it would be a good idea? Why undertake such a  journey? Mere mortals can only stand and wonder, others just set off even if it may kill them. As Kiwis are fond of saying 'Good on yer' Sarah Wilson.
