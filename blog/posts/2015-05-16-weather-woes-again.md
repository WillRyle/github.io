Many posts on this blog make some mention of the weather. It's understandable given how important it is to our endeavours around the garden and other outdoor activities. Last week the rains came to pay a visit and like a house guest over staying their welcome, refused to leave.

<!--more-->By Thursday so much rain had fallen that serious floods were <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/68557066/more-heavy-rain-and-traffic-pain-to-come-for-wellington" target="_blank">reported</a> over large areas of the lower North Island. Wellington's fragile transport infrastructure buckled, with the train system closed and major roads turned into rivers.

With no trains to take us home and the North-bound highway from the city closed, we stayed in town overnight lodging with a colleague of Denise.

Friday saw some respite from the rain but the aftermath left much work clearing roads of debris and checking the railway lines for damage. Our journey home was by bus, the rainÂ  continuing all the way.

This morning I checked the rain gauge and measured 67mm for the week - a lot less than the reported amount for the heavily affected areas on the other side of the Rimutakas, where a month's worth of rain had fallen in a day. With a cold Southerly wind and occasional heavy shower, today is clearly a day for filling the log basket, lighting the fire and taking it easy.
