We continue to clear the tree stumps that border the section, today working on the front boundary and are making steady progress.

Denise must have disturbed one of New Zealand's most peculiar looking creatures, an invertebrate known as a <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/native-animals/invertebrates/weta/" target="_blank">Weta</a>. These nocturnal creepy-crawlies have evolved over 190 million years into 70 species.

I got the camera and started taking photos, but the little blighter was not standing still and I chased it round the tree stump trying to get a good shot. The best of them are shown below (click to enlarge, but don't let them give you nightmares).
