News from the builder today that handover of the build is scheduled for Friday 3rd June. Rather helpfully, this is a long weekend with the Monday being a public holiday for the Queen's birthday.

The list of work yet to do is extensive, but each tradesman has their allotted days on site to complete their tasks. First up is the plasterer, who started today, and will be followed by the painter, tiler, fire installer, electrician, floor vinyl layer, plumber, carpet fitters, council compliance officer and cleaners.

D-Day can't come soon enough. Any charm our tiny rental cottage possessed has worn off - as expected - by the typical  frustrations of the whole build process.
