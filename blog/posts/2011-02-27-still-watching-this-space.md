We took time out today to make <a title="The Space toÂ Watch" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/the-space-to-watch/">another trip</a> to the Featherston Domain, a park on the edge of town. It's a steep climb to the summit but not too far to walk and the view over the surrounding countryside makes the effort worthwhile.

Whilst there we could check out the changes to the section, with the concrete and the builder's container-cabin clearly visible. (Click to enlarge)
