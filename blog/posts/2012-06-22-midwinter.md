While the Northern hemisphere basks in summer temperatures and glorious sunshine ;) the Antipodes has reached the shortest day of midwinter.

We only see New Bolton in daylight at weekends, it being dark when we leave to catch the train in the morning and dark when we get back after a hard day at the office, though the <a title="Webcam" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/webcam/">webcams</a> allow us a glimpse of what we're missing.

It's been cold and wet, with so much rain that the puddle which forms on the half-finished driveway has increased to the size of a pond and even acquired a couple of ducks. At least the grass doesn't grow so fast giving some respite from mowing duties.

In the North, the Winter solstace is marked by Christmas festivities and the near New Year, an acknowledgement of Nature's calendar. It's not surprising then, that New Zealand's earliest inhabitants used the Southern hemisphere's Winter solstace for the same purpose, the festival of <a href="http://www.matarikifestival.org.nz/" target="_blank">Matariki</a> starts the Maori New Year.
