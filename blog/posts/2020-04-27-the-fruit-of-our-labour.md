It has been a good few months since the <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2019/11/10/tree-planting-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great planting epic</a> was completed at the start of what turned out to be a lacklustre Summer - a cold start before changing to hot and dry. Nevertheless we have had some successes in the orchard and veggie garden.

Blueberries galore. Planted a few years ago, the four bushes struggled to get established and what few berries they produced were soon taken by the birds. It seems Blueberries like very acidic soil and after that was put right with the addition of an acidic fertiliser they picked up considerably. A fruit cage was built around them to keep the birds off and we were rewarded with a prolific crop.

This newly planted tree surprised us with its abundant fruit. Coming home from work we'd walk through the orchard and pick a few samples. On hot days, any windfalls were practically cooked by the sun.

Apples and Pears. The pear trees gave a modest yield. The ripened fruit was rather dry suggesting that the young trees struggled in the hot weather despite Denise's watering efforts. The apples were much the same, with a few small and not-very-juicy fruit. The exception was the later ripening Slack Ma Girdle cider apple which yielded a few fruit of spectacular flavour compared to the typical supermarket offering.

While the cherry tomatoes did well, the plum tomatoes failed abysmally - a story repeated by our gardening friends who reported the same results. It was a different story for the sweetcorn though, which has given us the best stand of corn yet. We have clearly learnt from experience here and planted closer together and protected them with windbreaks.

The fig tree seemed to enjoy the conditions after a mediocre season last year, giving so much fruit we let the birds have some.
