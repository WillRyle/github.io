Another glorious weekend in the Wairarapa - clear skies, light winds and not too hot for manual labour about the section. Specifically, continuing the clearing of the front boundary by removing the suckers from the poplars that once bounded the property.

We've been working on this area for the last couple of weekends. It's bounded by the road to one side and the drive to the other and in area and proportion is about the same as our entire garden back in England.

<p style="text-align:left;">We've still a bit more to do and there are the stumps to remove, but we'veÂ definitely got the better of it.</p>
