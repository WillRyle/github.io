I've re-discovered how time-consuming plumbing with PVC cement systems is. It's a ponderous, painstaking process that isn't forgiving of any mistakes and it seems to take ages.

By the end of the Christmas holiday, we had the through wall connections made, including the hydrotherapy jets, but this progress wasn't as far as expected. As if that wasn't enough,  the pipe which acts as a roller for the security cover fell off the coping and broke.

Parts that came with our previous order were incorrect so had to be sent again. When they arrived they were incompatible with what was sent before, so a third attempt to get the right combination of parts has to be made.

The hiatus caused by having to go to work allowed for a lengthy static leak test, which revealed a small but persistent drip from one of the underwater lights. Unable to tighten the plastic fitting any more for fear of it cracking, we had to pump out some water to lower the level enough to be able to dismantle and re-seal the offending connection.

This weekend, after the almost obligatory trip to Masterton - this time for a new roller pipe and other essentials - the plumbing marathon resumed. The water quality system was finished today and the blanks were removed from inside the pool to fill the pipes.

With no leaks apparent, we switched on the circulation pump to be met by a deafening silence. After a period of head scratching and switch checking, the thing refused to pump and we came to the conclusion that the electrician had missed one of those minor but important items that are essential to the flow of electricity.

By now well used to the obstacles that have cropped up during this project, we adjourned for the day with just the warm glow of job well done instead of the expected hum of the circulation pump.

Still to do is the hydraulic pipework for the swim current. With that done and a little help from the electricians, we are on the cusp of the first swim. The plumbing effort is not over yet, as the hydrotherapy circuit is still to be completed. Beyond that, there is the new roller for the security cover and panelling up the sides of the pool.
