Christmas is in the middle of Summer here in the Southern Hemisphere and something that takes getting used to. Christmas cards on sale show scenes of snow and red Robins, decorative lights have to compete with bright sunshine and public performances of Christmas carols are attended by Kiwis in Summer dress - shorts, t-shirts and jandals (flip-flops). One Christmas theme that does make sense here though is 'gathering winter fuel' - not for burning now, but in about six months when Summer is a distant memory. Denise has been busy doing just that...

We'd had two cords of logs (6.8 cubic metres) delivered a few weeks ago and they remained in an untidy heap until Denise took it upon herself to stack them up. It was hot work as Summer proper had finally arrived and temperatures were in the mid-to-high 20s Celsius.

As she made such a good job of it, I awarded her the inaugural title of New Bolton Log Stacking Champion and hope she defends her title next year.
