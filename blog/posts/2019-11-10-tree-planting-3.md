A few busy weekends - <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2019/06/16/busy-busy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as expected</a> - has seen the last of the latest tranche of trees finally planted. A count up of the trees planted in the last 18 months underlines the effort involved.

<!--more-->

In total, we've planted 36 fruit, olive and nut trees of assorted varieties that include old favourites like apple, plum and pear but with the addition of other specimens we'd never entertain - or even heard of - in the old country.

My favourite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persimmon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persimmon</a>. We've bought these from the supermarkets and really enjoyed them. Left to fully ripen, they get sweeter, softer and juicier the longer they are left. Across the driveway from the orchard, the new 'nut grove' has been established with 4 almond trees and 3 hazelnuts, each of assorted varieties.

The trees planted last season are bearing fruit - literally - but with mixed results. Of the 12 olives, 6 are thriving and gaining thick trunks and showing plenty of embryonic olives, while just 6 metres away another 6 seem to be struggling and haven't put on much growth.

In addition to the trees, we've made an attempt to establish a series of fruiting hedges to create separate bays for the orchard. To the blueberry and pomegranate we've added guava. The blueberries struggled until we realised they like very acidic soil and after Denise added the necessary magic, they are finally responding to treatment. The pomegranates got knocked back by a late frost last Spring, but with that lesson learnt, we made a fruit cage and covered it with frost cloth during the Winter. Now they are showing plenty of growth, though we're not likely to see any fruit this Summer.

Tree planting is not all we've been busy with; some 100 metres and more of hedging has been added plus the 54 grape vines in the <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2019/08/31/vine-planting-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vineyard</a> and its associated <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2019/08/11/vineyard-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infrastructure</a>. Top off that effort with Winter ailments, holidays in California and significant birthday celebrations and it's little wonder the veggie garden is looking forlorn. We're now in that period where the days are lengthening and getting warmer and there's still plenty of rain around, so the weeds and the grass are growing on overdrive. Just when we need both ride-on mowers, one of them objects to the years of abuse it has had and goes on strike. A rethink of our mowing policy is underway and is likely to involve the acquisition of a mower attachment for our venerable grey <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/gaining-traction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferguson tractor</a>, Gus. Before that can happen though, Gus needs work - some brakes would be nice, and an alternator to keep the battery charged for easy starting. A good service wouldn't go amiss either, as the oil probably dates to the last century.

It looks like our busy time isn't going to end any time soon, but fortunately we've got a Pete and a Neale, who between them have been a great help.
