A TV report recently related the tale of a farming couple from South Island.

After many years of hard graft establishing a successful dairy herd, shops, restaurant and other businesses, a lifelong ambition can be realised.

The dotty matriarch - appropriately name Dot - replete with pink hair and a fit of giggles, gets to start construction on her dream castle.

Watch the TVNZ report <a href="http://www.3news.co.nz/Dot-is-building-a-castle/tabid/1773/articleID/300359/Default.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>. (about 25 minutes)
