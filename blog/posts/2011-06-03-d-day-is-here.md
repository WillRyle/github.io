A last flurry of activity has seen carpets laid, doors hung, tiles stuck, inside cleaned and the equipment shed completed. Only the painters have failed to complete, the outside still waiting the final coat. The removal men are booked for tomorrow (Saturday) and next week will see a succession of ancillary trades - telephone and satellite installers - a delivery of firewood and the building inspector to check out the work done.

Now we start packing up, fortunately not a big job this time, and make ready for a day of carting stuff about. Check out the inside - video below...

The only work outstanding inside now is some tiling in the kitchen and bathrooms and for the painters to clear their junk from the pool room.
