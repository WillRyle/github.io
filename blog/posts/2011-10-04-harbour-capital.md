One of the good things about working in Wellington is the journey to and from work. Traditionally the daily commute is a bind and sometimes it still is when things break down, but for the most part the train ride in and out of New Zealand's Harbour Capital is a mini sight-seeing tour of its own.

Yesterday, as the train negotiated the edge of the harbour on the way home, we were treated to the usual vista of harbour and hills and half the New Zealand Navy at anchor, looking like a bad game of Battleships.

As if that wasn't enough, we got to do a bit of whale watching too, spotting an <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5725668/Orcas-sighted-in-Wellington-Harbour" target="_blank">orca breaking surface as it pottered about the harbour</a>.
