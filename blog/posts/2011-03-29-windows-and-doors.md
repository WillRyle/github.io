The slow progress of the roof - now just waiting for the ridge to be finished - stands in stark contrast to the efforts of the window fitters. The house has been completely glazed in a single day, and making the project landmark of being weather tight.

From this point the build is scheduled to take 7 weeks to completion. We should have a confirmed move-in date from the builder soon.

Next up is a site meeting with the electrician tomorrow (Wednesday), where we determine the small but important details of power, t.v and phone point locations, lighting, switching and all the other stuff that will never be thought about again - unless it is wrong, when it will annoyÂ endlessly.
