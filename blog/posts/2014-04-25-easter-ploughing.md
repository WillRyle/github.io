The long Easter weekend was designated as the time for ploughing the remaining part of the grounds in anticipation of grass sowing. Easter Monday gave the best weather and our pals Pete and Geoff duly arrived to take part in the first (and likely only) New Bolton Ploughing Match. This was to take place in two stages, the Long Run down the side boundary, and the Short Run along the road frontage.

We soon learned the finer detail of ploughing and with the plough tending to pull to the right, great effort was needed to keep on course. After a number of furrows were cut, it was possible to put one wheel of the tractor into the adjacent furrow to guide it along, but the tendency to drift remained.

A further complication arose when it was found that the screw that controlled the plough's depth had a habit of turning itself to a shallower setting - clearly some locking mechanism is required here.

It took about two hours to complete the long run and we adjourned for lunch - a Ploughman's Lunch, naturally with bread and cheese much in evidence.

We resumed ploughing on the shorter run and soon discovered the 'going' here was tougher. Incredibly, despite previous ground work in this area, we still uncovered some sizeable tree roots.

We called an end to the day's proceedings with the short run just over half way completed. Rain the next day prevented completing the job, but another hour's work on Wednesday morning saw it done. I spent the afternoon using <a title="Gaining Traction" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/gaining-traction/">Gus</a> and the spiked harrow to break down the furrows; and the modified rake implement to gather up weed lying on the surface. Finally, the loading tray allowed the detritus to be carted off to the compost heap.

We're about ready for the levelling irons, which will be tomorrow's job. In anticipation of good progress, I also booked a roller from the hire shop in the hope that some seeding will get done this weekend.

As for the winner of the Ploughing Match - that honour clearly went to The Plough, for leaving three middle-aged men worn out for a day.
