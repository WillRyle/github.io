It's been a week since we hosted the <a title="Livestock" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/08/31/livestock/" target="_blank">neighbour's sheep</a> on part of our section. They settled in over the weekend and ceased their bleating for food as they tucked in to the grass.

It's still dark when we leave home and get back in the evenings, so there was no way to see how they were doing until today, when we woke up to see a well-mown paddock.

Although it's officially Spring and somewhat warmer, it's still raining periodically and the grass is too wet to cut. With this in mind, the electric fence has been moved to give the sheep more work to do.

The front lawn is still steadily growing though and if it's too wet to cut, it can still be rolled to smooth out the bumps and hollows that have developed over Winter. With that in mind, a roller that can be towed behind the ride-on has been procured. When we get a break in the rain we might get chance to use it.
