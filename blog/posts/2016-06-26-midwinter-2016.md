It's June, so Mid-Winter in the Southern hemisphere. It also marks <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/d-day-is-here/" target="_blank">5 years</a> since we moved in to New Bolton.<!--more-->We've made a lot of changes since then, gradually adding the infrastructure to what had been a blank canvas. Despite the addition of the patio, rear deck, water tank, shed and veggie garden we've not finished yet.

Plans are finally with the local authority for consent to build a garage workshop. This is desperately needed as the shed is stuffed to capacity and some equipment is continuously exposed to the weather. The addition of a garage will allow our faithful Toyota bus to be housed out of the debilitating effect of the sun, which is wreaking havoc with the paintwork. It will also allow repair and restoration work on Gus - our <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/gaining-traction/" target="_blank">little grey Fergie</a> - to start, a job I've been reluctant to do without the proper equipment a garage can provide.

There's been a good bit of social activity in June, with Francis and Marie popping in for a weekend while in New Zealand; and the now traditional Mid-Winter feast, which saw 7 of us enjoying a full turkey dinner.

As well as building infrastructure we've been collecting together the tools and equipment that makes work about the place more efficient. Ride-on lawn mowers make short work of cutting the grass, the <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/spring-time-preparations/" target="_blank">tiller</a> easily turns over the veggie gardens and Gus is always on hand to act as a large <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/10/26/still-barking-mad/" target="_blank">engine-driven wheelbarrow</a> carting stuff about.

Our latest acquisition in the equipment department is a 2-furrow Ferguson plough. This arrived last week from a local vendor after I won the auction on <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz" target="_blank">Trade Me</a>, NZ's answer to EBay.

The plough and tractor combine to form the Ferguson System, inventor Harry Ferguson's revolutionary hydraulic agricultural tool. I coupled up the plough in order to move it to a more convenient place and was immediately struck by how complete it made Gus look - it's likely been many years since our TEA20 has had a Ferguson plough on its 3-point linkage. Its first job won't be until Spring, when we turn over the rear crop area, currently being cleaned and fertilised by the chooks. After that, I may get one of these:
