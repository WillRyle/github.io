From the 'Only in New Zealand' department - our daily commute to Wellington was made by bus today, rather than train. The trains were cancelled after an early morning freight train <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/5240687/Train-collides-with-cows" target="_blank">hit a herd of cows on the line</a>.

This is turning out to be an eventful week. Yesterday afternoon aÂ <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/5237027/Quake-felt-across-central-New-Zealand" target="_blank">6.5 magnitude earthquake</a> near Taupo caused a distinct rocking motion in our office on the fifth floor. This comes after a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/5222413/Auckland-jolted-by-earthquake" target="_blank">2.9 'quake in Auckland</a> last week - an apparently rare event for NZ's largest city - which had the locals over-emoting somewhat. The whining Aucklanders were met with hoots of derision from the natives of Christchurch, who are coping with the effects of earthquakes last September, again in February and many large aftershocks that continue.
