Curious to see how our humble lawnmower would perform on the ever-lengthening grass on the section, I today had a go at cutting it with our 14" petrol rotary.<a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lawn-mower-002.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-236 alignleft" title="Mad Mower 2" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lawn-mower-002.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lawn-mower-003.jpg" target="_blank"> <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-237" title="Mad Mower 1" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lawn-mower-003.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

I gave it about an hour - with breaks to give the thing a rest - of walking in an ever-increasing circuit and managed to cutÂ about 340 square yards. As this is only just over about 5% of the section, to cut it all would be quite an effort.

The good news though, is that not all needs cutting - the builders have taken over a good chunk and tree stumps render another sizeable area out-of-bounds to mowers. Repeating today's effort about 8 or 9 times should have all that can be cut done, doubtless by which time I'd need to start the process again - things grow quickly in the Wairarapa.
