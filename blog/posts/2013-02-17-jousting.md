It may come as a surprise to learn that there's such a body as the <a href="http://users.skynet.be/hackamores/IJL/IJL.htm" target="_blank">International Jousting League</a>, but there is. It's a seriously competitive sport and it so happened that 'knights' from around the World gathered at <a href="http://www.jousting.co.nz/" target="_blank">Harcourt Park</a> near Upper Hutt.
