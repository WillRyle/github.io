It's 5 years since we cycled up the <a title="The Rimutaka RailÂ Trail" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/the-rimutaka-rail-trail/">Rimutaka Rail Trail</a>, where we got to Summit easily enough but couldn't complete the descent into Wairarapa without leaving our transport on the wrong side of the hill. Just before Christmas we embarked on a journey to cycle the trail in its entirety.

From there it was an 8km ride to the start of the Rail Trail proper, this first stretch proving to be the most arduous with some steep hills to ascend. Thereafter the steady ride to summit was as leisurely as I remembered from the last trip, the gradient so gentle that it wasn't at all obvious that our elevation was increasing. This really is a ride for all the family - behind us was a group that included a girl of about 7 years old.

This was an altogether different experience. The trail consisted of large sharp stones and care was needed to avoid gaining too much speed. Like the Fell engines of the old railway, we had to brake all the way down.<a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/rail-trail-021.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1815 alignright" alt="Rail Trail 021" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/rail-trail-021.jpg?w=225" width="225" height="300" /></a>

The riding was relatively easy downhill to Cross Creek station, but our journey wasn't done yet as we had another 10km to take us back to Featherston, taking our total journey to about 40km.
