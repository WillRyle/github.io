After a splendid few days over Christmas, Nature averages out the sunshine with a bit of rain. Or even 24 hours and more of non-stop heavy downpour.

This is not confined to the Wairarapa, but affects the whole of North Island. Needless to say, there is very little activity outside in the neighbourhood, but we have managed to make progress in the pool room.

Missing a key component that prevents us completing the plumbing work, the focus has been on adding insulation to the pool walls and readying the new wood coping for the addition of the security cover. To this end, holes have been cut for the pool-side controls and the first of about five coats of yacht varnish applied.

When the varnishing is complete and the security cover installed, we will be "job stopped" until the missing parts are delivered.

We've learned from experience that adding water to the pool without a functioning water quality system leads to problems later, it being no easy task to get the water up to standard after it has been stood for some time. On the positive side, when the parts do arrive it will not take much work to complete the pool with just the liner, stainless steel and plumbing to finish.
