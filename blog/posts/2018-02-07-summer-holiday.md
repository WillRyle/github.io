A happy side effect of living in the Southern hemisphere is that Christmas coincides with mid-Summer. This means rather than just take a week or so off for the festive season, this can be merged with a Summer holiday. With friends from England joining us just before New Year, we had another reason to take a proper Kiwi extended holiday.

<!--more-->We started in conventional style with the now customary Christmas dinner with friends, a splendid feast of ham and turkey. Lynn and Keith arrived from England in good time for New Year's Eve celebrations and we immediately launched into a tour of Featherston's new hostelries - the newly re-opened Royal Hotel and the brand new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dragoninnfeatherston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Inn</a>.

The changes at <a href="http://www.theroyalhotel.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Royal</a> are worth mentioning. Closed suddenly about two and a half years ago, it has been sorely missed but we were cheered when it was taken over by new owners. There followed a long wait while a multi-million dollar restoration of the hotel was carried out and it finally opened just before Christmas. The transformation was remarkable, with the 11 rooms upstairs given a Victorian period makeover from a previous derelict state. The bar and restaurant got the same treatment and a definite steampunk theme can be traced amongst the Victoriana.

Despite the effect of their long flight, Lynn and Keith gamely hung on to see in the New Year and surfaced the next day to help out with our second feast. After a few days, we packed up our trusty van and headed for the ferry to South Island. We'd pre-booked accommodation on our route that took us through Blenheim and Reefton to Fox Glacier. Here we had 2 nights to get a close look at the glacier, which we managed in grand style aboard a helicopter. The weather was marginal, but we were able to land on the glacier and stumble about the ice taking photos for a few minutes before returning to base.

After the glacier, we headed North up South Island's West coast, the weather deteriorating all the while and making us feel lucky we'd got the helicopter flight in at all. The West Coast is well-known for its wet weather, moist air picked up over the Tasman drops its rain as it encounters the mountains. Annual rainfall here is measured in metres and stopping in Hokitika to visit the <a href="https://www.hokitikaglass.co.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glass blowing factory</a> had us dodging torrential downpours.

We continued on via Westport to Nelson, which is notable not only for its mild microclimate but also losing to Wellington in the competition to be NZ's capital city in 1865. We spent some time there sampling a few of the many local beers, visited the motor museum, dined out and took in the sights until heading back to Picton for the ferry home.
