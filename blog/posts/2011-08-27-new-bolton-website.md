The <a href="http://www.ryle.co.uk" target="_blank">New Bolton website</a> has been launched and featuresÂ web cams. Almost inevitably there is a JoshCam, with another looking out over the section.

This is a temporary arrangement until I source some wireless cameras or until Denise gets back and tells me to move the camera server from its new location and back in to the study. The camera locations are far from ideal, but finding suitable cameras to improve things - at a reasonable price - is proving problematic.

Note that New Zealand is GMT +12 hours and we're only getting daylight from about 7am until 6pm, so if all you see is darkness that's because it's dark here.
