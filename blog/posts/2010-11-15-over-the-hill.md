It's finally done, we've moved 'over the hill' and into the Wairarapa. Ensconced in a new rental property and the section purchase complete, we await the machinations of the local authority to grant the necessary building permits. With permits secured, we can break ground on the new build.

With plans lodged with the council, we adjourned to England to catch up with the relatives and returned to find the grass grown even higher and summer under way. Now things should start to get moving. Watch this space...
