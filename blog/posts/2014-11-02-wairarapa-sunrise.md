Denise is off to foreign parts again, this time for her day job and she's currently somewhere over Australia. It was an early start getting to Wellington airport for a 5 am check in, but with little traffic it only took an hour. On the return journey, I stopped at the summit of the Rimutaka Hill Road to read a text message and took the opportunity to take a photo. The sun was rising over Wairarapa and shining through the hills, the Western side of which was still in darkness. The cloud hung over the hills as it often does, but the Wairarapa plain in the distance had clear skies.
