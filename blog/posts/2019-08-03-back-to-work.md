After a splendid time in California, we took off from San Francisco late on Monday and landed at Sydney 13 hours later early on Wednesday, the International Date Line having disposed of Tuesday. I try not to dwell on it - time travel can scramble your brain. We hit the ground running and made it to work without drama on Thursday and Friday. Now a week later our <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2019/06/16/busy-busy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Busy Busy</a> schedule started.

We'd collected the 16 fruit and nut trees ordered earlier and Denise set about planting the first of those today. Meanwhile, I'd made a trip to the hire shop and picked up a post hole borer. Our friend and neighbour Neale - <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/fencing-more-to-it-than-meets-the-eye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last seen fencing our section</a> - joined me in setting out the long-planned vineyard. Assisted by neighbour Pete, we made good progress and I discovered that a post hole borer is not to be trifled with.
