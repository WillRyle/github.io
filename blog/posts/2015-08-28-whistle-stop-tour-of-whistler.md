Our first excursion out of town was to Whistler, to where we booked a trip on a mini-bus. The journey followed the route of the Rocky Mountaineer tourist train, but included several stops on the way. We left the bedlam of Vancouver behind and headed up the 'Sea to Sky' highway following the coast.

A notable stop was Porteau Cove, where a number of deliberately sunken wrecks give divers a good underwater playground.

Next stop was Shannon Falls, one of two water falls on the trip. We've seen loads of water falls in New Zealand and thought we might be a bit blasé by now, but the Canadian versions still impressed. <a href="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/dscf3761.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2151 size-medium" src="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/dscf3761.jpg?w=225" alt="DSCF3761" width="225" height="300" /></a>

We arrived in Whistler around midday, but skipped lunch in favour of booking tickets on the Peak 2 Peak gondola. This epic ride requires a 25 minute gondola ride from the town to the first peak, Whistler mountain. At the summit a separate larger gondola ride is strung 1400 feet above the ground to the neighbouring peak of Blackcomb mountain. This is a World record gondola ride, being the longest and highest and gives spectacular views in all directions.

We crossed to Blackcomb taking pictures all the way and were so impressed  we rode the Peak 2 Peak back to Whistler mountain rather than take the ride back to town. For anyone visiting here, this is a must-do and well worth the trip to Whistler.

Back on firm ground in Whistler, we had time for a quick bite and a walk around the town. As I was wearing <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/by-eketahuna/" target="_blank">'that' T-shirt</a>, Denise couldn't resist taking a photo for the collection.
