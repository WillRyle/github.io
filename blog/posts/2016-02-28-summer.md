It's been a while since my last blog and it's not all due to slothfulness. When we weren't working ourselves to a standstill in the garden we've been out and about enjoying the summer, leaving little time or energy to let our good readers know what's been happening in our slice of New Zealand.

Christmas Day was a splendid affair, with friends round for the traditional feast five of us sat down and tucked in to ham - the Kiwi traditional Christmas joint - with all the trimmings. The feasting was interspersed with games of croquet and Boules and wrapped up with a movie.

A few days later, Denise made an unscheduled trip back to England leaving me to hold the fort and a long list of jobs to do during her absence. This was when most of the 'working to a standstill' occurred. Without my better half, I tended to make an early start on the job list and went without proper sustenance until the heat and hunger made it hard to continue. Despite that, I made good progress planting out the remaining seedlings, weeding, watering, feeding and cutting the grass.

New Year's Day was a blokes only affair with Pete and Geoff joining me to tuck into one of Pete's special culinary creations. There was wine and beer and robust games of croquet.

A special treat we'd been looking forward to since last November when we booked it, was the Meandering Lunch around the vineyards in Martinborough. This turned out to be a splendid affair, starting at Martinborough square at 10am on a warm sunny Saturday, we were served champagne before boarding one of four coaches, each of which departed to a different vineyard. On arrival we were serenaded by a live band and invited to taste a selection of the wine made at the vineyard. There followed one course of a sit down meal produced by the region's top chefs and wine chosen after the tasting. After about an hour and a half we boarded the bus for the next vineyard and repeated the experience, in total four times. By day's end we'd sampled some of the finest wine and food on offer in the Wellington Region, danced to live music and enjoyed the good company of our friends.

New Year's Eve saw us out with friends again, this time to Carterton, which boasts a fine brewery just a few doors down from the best curry house in Wairarapa. First order of business was to sample the produce of the <a href="http://www.regent58.co.nz/" target="_blank">Regent 58 Brewery</a> which, as expected, turned out to be a fine drop. As the Indian restaurant no longer has an alcohol licence, we bought bottles of beer to take away and made our way to the <a href="http://www.indiantaj.co.nz/" target="_blank">Indian Taj</a>. As ever, the food was excellent, and as ever, after studying the menu for a good 10 minutes, Geoff ordered his usual - butter chicken.

We cheated a bit and bought some seedlings but were rewarded all the same with bumper crops of tomatoes, chard, potatoes and sweetcorn. The cauliflowers all came good, but some had been badly eaten by a bug which had bored up through the stem. The early potatoes were ready for Christmas dinner and were of a good size and quantity compared to earlier years. The main crop is still in the ground, but we dug one plant up to see how they were doing and we look like we're on the way to a good yield. I think our success owes a lot to the odd downpour of rain which kept the tank topped up and good use of the irrigator. Even in 'manual' mode it's a great time saver, just needing to be driven to the next row of plants, the timer set for an appropriate length of time and left to get on with it.

As if such a bountiful harvest wasn't enough, the chooks have started laying eggs. Production is a bit intermittent just now as not all the girls are laying and some eggs have thin or no shells. This can be any of a number of factors - heat; it's been very hot lately - calcium deficiency; a possibility as they're on pullet food still - or just because they're young and laying their first eggs. What eggs we have had for breakfast have been of excellent quality and flavour.
