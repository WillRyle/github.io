A long weekend has allowed us more time to continue the work in the vegetable garden and Saturday saw the construction of the boxing around the second wind break.

Having had practice last weekend, better progress was made this time and we were ready to fill it with bark by close of play.

On Sunday, despite strong winds, we started Gus and loaded up several times with bark until the desired level was achieved.
