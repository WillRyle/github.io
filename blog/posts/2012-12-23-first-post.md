The long awaited fencing project is finally under way. The arrival of a consignment of posts and rails coincided with handy neighbour Neal finding some free time from his day job in the vineyards to set the first post at the corner of the 60 metre front boundary.

Some months earlier I'd arranged the acquisition of a concrete mixer which was intended to create the necessary to set the fence posts in place and seeing the posts going in moved me to collect the new toy. There's something satisfying about 'getting a mix on' and I'm looking forward to loading the mixer and barrowing loads of concrete to set the posts in place. For those that feel the same way about construction, check out the drum on this beauty.
