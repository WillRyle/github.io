Being winter in the Southern hemisphere, things have slowed down outside. We sowed lupins in the second veggie patch and planted garlic - it's customary here to plant garlic on the shortest day and harvest it on the longest and for once we got something in on time.

The newly sown orchard area's grass is growing, albeit slowly in the short days and cool weather, but the grass is having to compete with the inevitable weeds.

Midwinter's day saw a repeat of <a title="A Not-So-Bleak Mid-Winter" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/a-not-so-bleak-mid-winter/">last year's</a> successful 'Christmas' dinner. Hosted this time at Sue's splendid Colonial villa, about eight of us gathered for turkey and all the trimmings with vegetarian option for those strange people who don't eat meat.

Following on from our <a title="All Kiwiâ€™d Up" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2014/05/30/all-kiwid-up/">Citizenship ceremony</a>, applications for New Zealand passports were made and they duly arrived in less than two weeks. Resplendent in black with a Silver Fern motif, Denise will be the first to put hers to use as the day job takes her to Adelaide in September.
