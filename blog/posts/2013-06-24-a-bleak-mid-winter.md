It's the Southern hemisphere's mid-winter and last week Nature let us know. A large storm trundled across New Zealand and all hell broke loose. It rained all week, but the main event was on Thursday...

Strong winds and heavy rain caused trouble far and wide, with trees uprooted and power lines cut. Buildings lost their roofs and homes <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8823953/Major-storm-mop-up-gets-under-way" target="_blank">lost power</a>. <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8823953/Major-storm-mop-up-gets-under-way" target="_blank">Wellington</a> was badly affected and one of the city's main rail lines was cut when the storm washed away the track where it runs alongside the harbour.

An Inter-Islander ferry broke its moorings and had to be tethered to a tug to prevent further damage. Fishes were tossed ashore.

The journey to work the next day was by bus and we were able to see the train track with the rails in mid-air, the ballast beneath having being washed away.

Within 24 hours a further 37mm had fallen.

Our normally well-drained ground was saturated and some large puddles had formed on the area that was nearly ready for sowing.
