A much-needed break for Easter, our first since Christmas, started yesterday on Good Friday. We took a trip to the seaside, heading off to <a href="http://www.riversdalebeach.co.nz/" target="_blank">Riversdale Beach</a> on the East coast of North Island, a change from <a title="East-West Divide" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/east-west-divide/">Lake Ferry</a>.

Getting there is a bit more involved than Lake Ferry - about a 90km trip - but the ever-splendid Wairarapa scenery and near empty roads made the journey a pleasure.

The beach was buzzing with all manner of 2, 3 and 4-wheeled contraptions, quad bikes and trikes in the main, as people busied themselves trying to catch a meal. Fishing was the main method, but hardier souls waded out into the surf to drop lobster pots.

We took a walk along the beach, coming to a particularly rocky section that appeared to be a good fishing spot, judging from the number of fishermen - and women - trying their luck. A sign indicated the number and size of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81ua" target="_blank">paua</a> (a kind of abalone) and lobster permitted per person, in an attempt to conserve stocks and prevent over fishing.
