Steady progress on the build has reached the point where all the plaster boards and doors are now in place and the internal layout has taken its final shape. Coming next week we expect the plasterers to do their thing. Our next task is to discuss internal and external colours with the painter so that he's ready to go.

Yet to do is second fix electrical and plumbing, floor tiling, kitchen installation, painting and floor coverings. Our initial move in date of end April/early May has slipped due to a number of reasons, mostly bureaucratic and weather related, but I'm optimistic that the list of outstanding tasks will soon dwindle and we'll be moving out of our tiny rental soon enough.

Encroaching Autumn has seen shorter days and cooler temperatures, but given us the opportunity to confirm that solar gain does work. Going inside in the evening after a sunny day, the house was noticeably warm even though there's no heating yet. The combination of large expanses of Northerly facing glass and good insulation traps the heat from the sun and keeps it inside.

Outside, we spend our time removing unwanted undergrowth and have made good progress. Arriving on site today, our friendly neighbour Doug the mower man was making short work of the grass with his custom ride-on mower.

By the time he'd finished the whole section was looking resplendent with its new haircut.
