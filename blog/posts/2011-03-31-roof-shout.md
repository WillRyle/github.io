The finishing touches were added to the roof today, signalling its completion. With the windows and doors fitted, the weatherboard was finished off by trim around the openings and building corners. From the outside, there's only guttering and rainwater pipes to add.

Meanwhile, progress continues on the inside...<!--more-->

Following our site meeting on Wednesday, the electrician has been busy and completed the first fix today, setting a new personal record for the number of power points fitted to one room (I insisted the study was generously equipped with power outlets). Next up will be the plumber, who has been working out the best location for the hot water tank. This will be a 350 litre affair with coils to take heat from the wood burner and at some point in the future, solar panels. An electric element will provide heat when the other sources are unavailable or insufficient.
