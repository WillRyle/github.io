<div id="msgcns!6DC4413C2DF787C8!1037" class="bvMsg"><p>Saturday the 25th was ANZAC day. Commemorative services are held at dawn, the same time that soldiers from Australia and New Zealand went ‘over the top’ at Gallipoli in 1915. <p>In Wellington, ANZAC day is one of the few days of the year that the Wrights Hill Fortress is opened to the public. The fortress was built during World War Two when the threat of Japanese invasion was very real. It is located on a hill top over looking Wellington at Karori, or more accurately, <em>in</em> the hill top. <p><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/anzacday0205b35d.jpg" rel="WLPP"><img title="Entrance to Wrights Fortress, Karori, Wellington" style="display:inline;" height="480" alt="Entrance to Wrights Fortress, Karori, Wellington" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/anzacday0205b35d.jpg?w=300" width="640" /></a>  <p>Entrance to Wrights Fortress, Karori, Wellington. <p>Three massive 9.2 inch guns were originally planned, with the ability to send a 380lb shell a distance of 18 miles. With two guns under construction and with the Pacific war progressing in favour of the Allies, the order for the third gun was cancelled. The three gun pits are accessed through a network of underground tunnels. The fortress also housed a magazine, power generators and command post. The guns, each weighing a total of 135 tons, could traverse 360 degrees, the motive power coming from a hydraulic system whose pumps were run off the electrical power created by two huge generators. These generators were left in place when the fortress was decommissioned, probably because taking them away would have been too much like hard work. <p><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/anzacday0155b35d.jpg" rel="WLPP"><img title="One of the two engine driven generators " style="display:inline;" height="480" alt="One of the two engine driven generators " src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/anzacday0155b35d.jpg?w=300" width="640" /></a>  <p>The fortress was abandoned in 1960. The guns were cut up and sold for scrap – to the Japanese – and the gun pits filled in. The fortress is now in the care of <a href="http://www.whfrs.org.nz/" target="_blank">Wright Hill Fort Restoration Society</a>, who have dug out two of the gun pits and carried out much restoration work.  <p>An aerial view of the fortress in Google maps is <a href="http://maps.google.co.nz/maps/ms?source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=115886524654780408240.0004686a94d2ca86dd1cf&amp;ll=-41.295474,174.738949&amp;spn=0.002084,0.003696&amp;z=18" target="_blank">here</a>.
