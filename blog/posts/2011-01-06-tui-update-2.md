It seems our <a title="TuiÂ Update" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2010/12/29/tui-update/">resident </a>tui has found his wings and flown away.

He was last seen with a determined look about him, taking short hops about the plum tree, descending one branch after another then climbing to the top of the tree and repeating the exercise. He has spent the last few days doing this, but his major incentive to get airborne must have something to do with another - flying - tui that was seen perched in his plum tree. If his visitor was female, it's quite likely he's been lured away to produce the next generation.
