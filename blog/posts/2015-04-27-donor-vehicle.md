With the hot, dry weather behind us now as we head towards Winter, the need for irrigation has passed. Looking ahead though, there are several improvements to the <a title="Irrigation" href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/irrigation/">irrigation contraption</a> that would make life a lot easier.

A better solution would be to have the device motorised so that it can be moved up and down by one person without the need for rope and pulleys.

With this in mind, I made contact with a local mobility scooter repair shop and for a trifling sum came away with a complete and functional - if somewhat tired - scooter. This will be the donor vehicle for Phase 1 of the irrigator upgrade which will see it, under operator control, driving from one row of veggies to the next.

The plan is to use the scooter's motors, driven wheels, batteries and controller such that each trolley of the irrigator is motor powered.

On a 'test drive' around New Bolton, the scooter handled grass and the relatively soft ground of the veggie garden without any fuss, though it needed to be in top gear to do so at a reasonable speed with me aboard. I don't see any traction problems, especially if the ground traversed is reasonably level and firm, something that we have the equipment to achieve. What may be an issue is if the trolleys of the irrigator move at different rates causing it to twist across the garden rather than moving straight ahead. How, or even if, this will work in practice has yet to be determined, but we've a good few months to experiment and find out.
