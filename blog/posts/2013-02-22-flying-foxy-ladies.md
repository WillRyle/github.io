Heading North from Featherston and just a few hours later we arrived at <a href="http://www.gravitycanyon.co.nz" target="_blank">Gravity Canyon</a>, home of all things extreme sports related.

Denise and Marie quickly resolved to try the Flying Fox. We'd seen the video on the web site, but no-one else was around having a go to show what it was like. After our performance in the <a title="UnexpectedÂ Celebrity" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/unexpected-celebrity/" target="_blank">promotional video</a>, the two Mrs Ryles took the steep walk to the start point.

Francis and I gallantly stayed behind to record their achievement. Watch the video and you'll believe a woman can fly.
