It's been a while since we acquired a two furrow <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2016/06/26/midwinter-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferguson plough</a> to go with our TEA20 tractor. For one reason or another, it remained unused until today.

As part of our preparation for spring planting the veggie gardens at the front of the house had been tilled over, now it was the turn of the crop area at the rear. The chook house had already found a new spot and an area some 30 metres by 3.5 metres was to be put under the plough. This will be where ALIS the irrigator will be doing field trials this Summer.

With the plough attached to the tractor, it took only half a dozen passes to do the job. It wasn't that straightforward of course - the plough ran too deep causing the wheels to spin, despite adjusting the levelling box. The work was done before it was realised that some top link adjustment might have helped to control the depth.
