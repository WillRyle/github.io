Good progress over the weekend with the main area tilled over. About 10 hours on the tiller over Saturday and Sunday gave the desired result.

Today saw the tractor in action, first with the rake, in an attempt to break up the larger clods of dirt, then with the levelling irons.

Results were mixed, with the leveller gathering clumps of dead vegetation and then skipping over the whole lot.

With the leveller not making the desired impact, it was decided to call a halt and let the vegetation decompose some more before trying again.
