It's a year this Queen's Birthday weekend since we moved in to the house, an event that marked the end our eighteen month quest to secure our own place in the Wairarapa.

Continual mowing of the grass this summer has improved its quality noticeably, but we still plan on re-seeding the ground that we're not giving over to food production.
