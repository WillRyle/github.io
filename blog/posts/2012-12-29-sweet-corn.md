The great corn planting epic is finally over. The last seeds went in yesterday, leaving us aching with the effort.

It has taken us a few weeks to complete the task, giving time for the first seeds to be planted to emerge and gain a few inches in height.

It won't be long before we have to repeat the process with peas, which are going to be planted between the sweet corn. The peas will grow up the corn and fix nitrogen in the soil, which the sweet corn needs.

The next project is under way. This is the construction of a shed to house the garden equipment, tools, bicycles and other stuff still cluttering the house. In parallel to that there will be concrete mixing to fix the fence posts in position as Neal continues his work.
