You'd be forgiven for thinking the work on the pool had stalled, but this is not the case. While I've been putting together the order for parts, I've also fixed the pool panels in place and carried out work on the conduit between pool and pumps...

In addition, the deep area required preparing for the liner by rendering smooth. Now that the order for parts is ready - after several iterations while I found extra items to add - it will take some time for the liner to be made and the order delivered. Once it arrives installation will proceed at a pace, though I'll need the help of an electrician to commission the pumps. I just hope I haven't missed anything of the order that will hold things up.
