This weekend we harvested some of the larger sweetcorn cobs, picked some peas and dug up some potatoes. We pondered what to make with such ingredients and searched on-line for recipes, one of which was an obvious choice. So, what to do with peas, potatoes and sweetcorn? Make <a href="http://caloriecount.about.com/pea-potato-sweetcorn-curry-recipe-r101633" target="_blank">Pea Potato and Sweetcorn curry</a> of course, and very tasty it was too.
