<a href="https://kiwiwill.photos.live.com/self.aspx/.BlogImages/Power%20Boat%20Race.wmv" target="_blank">This </a>is a movie clip I shot at last yearâ€™s powerboat race in Wellington harbour.

The whole event smacked of organised chaos with powerboats of different classes in different races charging about pursued by camera helicopters. All the while, the normal activity of the harbour continued unfazed, with the ferry making its regular departure and yacht crews taking advantage of the ideal conditions.
