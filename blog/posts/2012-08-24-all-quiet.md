It's Winter, so natural that activity about the site will slow. We've not been completely idle though. In between downpours of rain, some useful work has been done. During the downpours, plans have been hatched and refined, contacts established and ducks lined up nicely. Today the first of them was knocked over.

We have three sizeable infrastructure projects to complete; the driveway, the fence and turning over, levelling and re-seeding the section. The fence needs to be done last, after the re-seeding operation.

I contacted Steve of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Taungatara" target="_blank">Clydesdales</a> fame and arranged for him to plough, disc, level and re-seed the section, come September. I've been at work with the tiller doing parts of the section that may have tree roots in them and so reduce the risk of damaging his plough.

The fencing has been on hold for some time, but I had yet to find a supplier of gates. This was resolved after a chat with a neighbour from around the corner, who turns out to be a builder and quite happy to make bespoke gates.

For the driveway we called on the services of young Tim, who did sterling work <a title="Stumps Away!" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/10/16/stumps-away/" target="_blank">removing the tree stumps</a>, and he arrived on site today. The work involved pulling out an unwanted fence post, removing topsoil to enlarge the parking area, then carting in truckloads of aggregate and levelling the fill. The removed topsoil is spread about the section to contour areas near the road where there's an abrupt change of level.

By coincidence Denise was off work with a cold and managed to capture the activity on camera.

So, while it's been all quiet on the blog, the minor work that's been ongoing has now reached a level that's worth reporting.
