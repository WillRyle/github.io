Back from a trip to visit relatives in Australia and England, we picked up the work in the orchard - collecting seven trees we'd pre-ordered from a local nursery. In between the continuing rain showers we set about planting them.

It was necessary to spread the work over two weekends because of the weather, but some hard work this afternoon saw the job completed. At least digging the holes was relatively easy in the rain-softened ground.

The seven trees are a mix of four apple and three pear. The apples include two cider trees of a variety splendidly named 'Slack ma girdle', which we're hoping will eventually yield enough juicy pulp to make a Summer's worth of cider.

These trees are in the front boundary, laid out in three rows, zig-zagged at 3metre spacing. They join a peach tree and space remains for another six, which we'll add as we decide what to plant.

Elsewhere, more hedging plants have been obtained. These will form a wind break for several rows of grape vines. We're a way off from planting the vines as we've just missed the best time of year to do that, but that leaves us plenty of time to install the supporting infrastructure that they demand.
