There's been major earth-moving activity at New Bolton in the last few days, involving a large excavator and a truck, the two combining into the one-man enterprise known as Dittmer Earthmoving.

I watched from work via the webcam as owner and operator Tim Dittmer arrive on site on Friday, truck towing trailer with mounted excavator. Within minutes he had unloaded the digger, using its 'thumb' attachment to casually pull out an unwanted fence post and toss it aside as heÂ manoeuvred into position.

The tree stumps didn't stand a chance as Tim worked along the boundary plucking them from the ground like a dentist pulling teeth. The piles of extracted stumps were scooped up and dropped into the truck, which was driven off when full.

The next task was to remove the suckers that radiated from each stump for some distance. For this a quick change of attachment was needed - the fearsome looking ripper.

This device was dragged through the ground, easily lifting the roots it encountered and allowing them to be picked up and dropped in the truck. Next task was levelling out the disturbed ground; clods of earth were pushed into the tree stump holes and firmed into place by driving the digger over the area.

By Saturday afternoon New Bolton was close to our target of a being a 'clean sheet', nearly all the removal of debris done and ready for us to start building the site in our own image. Still to do: remove the large pile of dirt left by the builders and remove the remaining piles of tree stumps and roots.
