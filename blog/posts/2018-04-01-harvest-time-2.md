It's that time of year again, where we reap what we've sown, watered, weeded, fertilised all Summer.

<!--more-->The sweet corn yielded a bucket full of rather stunted cobs, as we expected given the repeated battering they've had this Summer. <img class="  wp-image-2494 alignleft" src="https://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/pumpkins.jpg" alt="pumpkins" width="293" height="488" />The pumpkins did a lot better and Denise filled her garden trolley with some of a good size. Compared to the sweet corn, the pumpkins have been relatively low maintenance. Grown from seed we saved from shop-bought product, they also cost a lot less.

With the crop area picked clean, the area was driven over with one of the ride-on mowers to chop up the residual vegetation, then it was out with the tiller to turn the soil over and dig in the mulch. Next up is tractor time with chain harrow to rake it all level and then seed with oats and mustard seed to green manure the ground over Winter.

For now though, the site is weed-free for the first time since Spring.
