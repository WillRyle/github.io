The fickle weather that has frustrated attempts to get the section rotary hoed finally abated and gave Tim the chance to get a tractor on site.

Unfortunately, that same wet and sunny weather made the grass grow faster than we could cut it. <a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/christmas-parade-003.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-878" title="Denise in the long grass" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/christmas-parade-003.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Despite our efforts with line trimmer and the neighbour's lad driving the ride-on about, the grass was too long in many place to make the progress we'd have liked.

It seems the tractor and hoe just weren't man enough for the job in hand. Even where the grass was short it struggled. <img class="size-medium wp-image-879 alignright" style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;" title="All in a day's strimming" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/christmas-parade-001.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Our section had been neglected for quite some time prior to us buying it and the grass had grown long and formed tough clumps that, despite being mowed regularly over the last year, still persisted.

While a good job's been made of what has been done, we're left with not enough to carry on as planned and are taking the Christmas break to work out the way forward.

We had wanted the bulk of the section turned over so that we could lay out the garden and sow a new lawn. The problem now is that by the time we're ready for that, we'll be in Wairarapa's hot summer and will have trouble establishing a new lawn in the hot and dry conditions that persist then.

There are three areas that have been hoed, part of the front boundary, the North East boundary and behind the house, where the builder's spoil heap had prevented the grass from growing.

Now it's Christmas Eve and we're enjoying some fine, warm weather. If it continues unbroken into the New Year, then we've missed our chance to sow the lawn as any seed will just burn up in the heat. On the other hand, if we don't get something growing, the heat will dry out the ground and the first strong wind will whip up a dust storm. I'm beginning to see why farmers always pay close attention to the weather.
