It's been impossible not to notice that there's a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/" target="_blank">bit of a rugby tournament</a> under way in New Zealand at the moment. One can ignore the wall to wall TV coverage, but not the brightly-shirted and face-painted crowds that wandered around Wellington last Friday, getting in the way of commuters heading home.

The occasion was the opening ceremony of the Rugby World Cup, which I saw on the pub TV while finishing off the week with a few beers. It was widely hailed as a splendid success and I have to agree it did have a touch of the spectacular - as well as being slightly bizarre in places.
