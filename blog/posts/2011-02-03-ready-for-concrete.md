The block work has been back filled with aggregate to a level that leaves room for 100mm of concrete and the plumber has positioned the under floor pipework.

The reinforcing bar protruding around the perimeter will be bent horizontally so that it is in the middle of the concrete and so ties the block work walls to the floor.

The top course of blocks is stepped to give the finished floor level and aggregate level.

Elsewhere on the section, our mower man contact has made good his promise and turned up to cut the grass. His custom ride-on lawn mower proving itself more than a match for the tufty grass now about 12" high.

He has more to cut though, it seems he didn't fit a larger fuel tank to match the souped-up engine he installed and the endurance suffers as a result.

As always, click the pictures for a larger version.
