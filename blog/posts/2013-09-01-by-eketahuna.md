Eketahuna tourist office sells a fetching collection of T shirts bearing the legend 'London, Paris, New York...Eketahuna' which so impressed me when we passed through last February that I bought one.

The office also displays pictures of travellers wearing their Eketahuna T shirts in far-flung exotic locations. While Bolton hardly qualifies as exotic, it is as far-flung from Wairarapa as it's possible to get short of entering orbit, so I thought my contribution as valid as those with the Great Pyramid or the Taj Mahal in the background.

<p style="text-align:left;">Update: Eketahuna is a small town in Wairarapa, not famous for anything in particular apart from a <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/92Gt3" target="_blank">giant kiwi</a> and having a splendid name.</p>
