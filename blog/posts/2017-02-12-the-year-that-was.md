It's February already and this is the first blog post of the year. Things have been busy with one thing or another and quite frankly we're glad to see the back of 2016.

Since the <a href="https://willryle.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/alis-the-irrigator/" target="_blank">Irrigator</a> series of posts, a lot has happened.

November saw a magnitude 7.8 <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/nz-earthquake/86459712/Photos-Widespread-damage-after-large-earthquake-hits-NZ" target="_blank">earthquake</a> that caused a lot of damage and disruption in Wellington and Kaikoura on South Island. Mercifully, there were no casualties, but the day job had us working from home and then from temporary offices.

A few days after the quake, Denise had news from the Old Country which reported that her mother was in a poorly condition. She immediately left for England - her fourth trip in the last year. She arrived in time to see her mum, who died two days later, only three months after her father succumbed to cancer.

2016 wasn't finished with us yet, when I was given the news that the day job was to dispense with my services and make me - and a good number of colleagues - redundant.

Denise stayed for the funeral, visited relatives and made it back to New Zealand just in time for Christmas. By the time she got back, I had another job to start in the New Year.Â  Life goes on, with all its trials and tribulations. It's a new year now and things are moving on - more on that in the next post.
