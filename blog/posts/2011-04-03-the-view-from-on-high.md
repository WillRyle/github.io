We made another trip to the Lone Pine lookout yesterday (Saturday) to see how the view has changed since we <a title="Still Watching This Space" href="http://willryle.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/still-watching-this-space/">last</a> went.

Whilst making our way up the steep climb, we noticed a number of very red mushrooms.

Looking at them, you'll forgive us for not being inclined to pick them for breakfast. We'd never noticed these before, so it must be their time of year.

At the summit we were met with the usual vista of the Wairarapa , resplendent under clear skies, as the period of fine weather we've enjoyed all over the Wellington Region for the last week continues.

Later that afternoon, we continued our work of clearing the unwanted poplar remains from the boundaries, making some noticeable progress.
