We spent this afternoon unwrapping and positioning the six steel panels that make up the pool walls. They have been stacked in storage since our container arrived in New Zealand three and a half years ago and positioning them also frees up the space they occupied for other junk.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pool-panels-010.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-699" title="Pool Panels 010" src="http://willryle.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/pool-panels-010.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The panels are only loosely assembled, effectively plonked in place to allow clearances between pool and concrete to be checked. All the measuring and re-measuring is fine, but the acid test is actual fitting. Needless to say there were no problems, the builders have implemented the Endless Pools concrete plan with great accuracy. There is adequate clearance to allow the panels to be anchored to the floor and route the water and hydraulic pipes to their required positions around the pool. Still to do is determine the location for the security cover roller mechanism.</p>

With that done, measurements are taken and despatched to Endless Pools who then make the custom liner. At the same time we'll order the necessary parts required when a pool is moved and to replace the components that we didn't bring with us, being too worn or too difficult to clean adequately.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It will take about a month to make the liner and ship it and the other parts to New Zealand, which will allow time to prepare the other pool infrastructure. The pumps and ancillary equipment will reside in the already built equipment shed, but the conduit for pipework between pool and shed is still to be made good.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">The partial in-ground installation leaves about 2 foot above floor level and will allow easy entry by just sitting on the coping and swinging one's feet over the side and on to the benches.</p>
